Tableð1:1Þ where k, S 2 0 , R i , N, F, ϕ, λ, and σ represent photoelectron wave vector, reduction factor by multiple scattering effect, ith species at distance R, coordination number, back scattering amplitude function, phase shift function, mean free path of photoelectron, and Debye Waller factor, respectively. EXAFS can provide structural information on bond distance, coordination number, and atomic species of the neighbors of the absorbing atom. Thus, XAFS can determine the chemical state and local bonding structure for a selected atomic species. XAFS can be applied to any sorts of functional materials such as catalysts, sensors, biomaterials, fuel cells, secondary batteries, electronic devices, optical and magnetic devices, thin films, nano-medicines, etc. without requirement of long-range ordering in structures, in any atmospheres such as gas phases, liquids, solids, vacuum, reaction conditions, etc., at low-high temperatures, for any mixtures and composites. XAFS has great advantages in deciding molecular-level structures and electronic states of a variety of materials not only in a static state but also in a dynamic state (in situ/operando conditions), which are not possible by other techniques due to their theoretical and experimental analysis limitations. With these advantages as base, the weak points of XAFS are also noted as follows. The XAFS information is one dimensional one averaged over all absorbing atoms with different local structures and environments involved in a sample. The XAFS curve-fitting analysis is not precise in contrast to XRD analysis; e.g., error ranges of bond distance and coordination number are at least AE0.001 nm and AE10 %, respectively, for most samples of catalysts, nanoparticles, and surfaces. Although the XAFS curve-fitting results involve those error ranges, the XAFS techniques can provide significant structural parameters and electronic states for catalysts, nanoparticles, and surfaces in static and dynamic states, to which other modern physical techniques cannot be applied. Thus, the XAFS techniques have the unique and large advantages enough for scientific discussion on the physical and chemical properties of functional samples, but the XAFS analysis results may be further exactly discussed with the aid of other complementary experiments and theoretical calculations.XAFS has had a great impact on catalyst research, identifying short-range structures and electronic states of many catalytic systems with nanocrystalline, Fig.Finally, science and technology is the wisdom and spirit obtained by humanity through the long history of evolution and is the biggest contributor to the optimization of society. Through the diligent construction of modern science and technology we can build a sustainable society. We have great expectations for advanced XAFS and related techniques for catalysts, nanomaterials, and surfaces in our life and future. The following chapters treat with fundamentals, recent applications, and future prospects of XAFS.Formally, the theory of XAS is based on Fermi's golden rulewhich requires a summation over exact many-body final states F j i, with energies E F . However, practical calculations depend on the reduction of this relation to an effective, independent particle theory that takes into account several important many-body effects. The theoretical advances in recent years are the result of an improved understanding of these effects and accurate new approximations, in particular for inelastic losses and vibrational damping

The EXAFS Equation:
One of the key developments in the history of EXAFS was the famous equation of Sayers, Stern, and Lytle, which represents the normalized fine structure χ ω ð Þ ¼ μ ω ð Þ À μ 0 ½ =μ 0 in XAS in terms of oscillatory contributions from near-neighbor atoms. Here μ 0 is the jump in the XAS at the edge. Although their model was heuristic, it included two key many-body effects, namely the mean free path of the photoelectron and vibrational dampingexcept that all quantities are redefined to include curved-wave and many-body effects implicitly. In particular f eff is the effective curved wave scattering amplitude for a given photoelectron wave number k defined relative to the absorption threshold (or Fermi level μ) for X-ray absorption, i.e., with kare close to the geometrical near-neighbor distances in a material, but shifted by system dependent phase shifts, δR % 1  2 dΦ k =dk. Moreover this MS path representation permits an analysis of experimental XAFS signals in terms of geometrical and vibrational properties of a material, provided one has a reasonable approximation of the phase shifts and λ k .

Many-Body XAS Formula:
Perhaps the easiest way to incorporate many-body effects is to follow the two-step approach derived by Campbell et al.The shape of the spectral function A ω; ω 0 À Á typically consists of a sharp "quasiparticle" peak of width related to the inverse mean free path, together with a broad satellite. Consequently the EXAFS problem can be factored into two parts: an effective quasi-particle XAS μ 1 ð Þ ω ð Þ and a part that accounts for inelastic losses. The quasi-particle XAS can be calculated using an independent-particle Fermi's golden rule, with the ΔSCF approximation, i.e., with the final single-particle states f i calculated with the final state Hamiltonian in the presence of the core-holewhere d ¼ Ẽ Á r is the dipole operator and P the projection operator onto unoccupied states. Although this is a considerable simplification to Eq. (2.1), the calculation and summation over final states in the golden rule is a serious computational bottleneck at high energies: the sum can only be carried out efficiently for highly symmetric systems such as atoms, small molecules, or periodic solids. On the other hand, many systems of interest lack symmetry. Reciprocal space (i.e., band structure) methods; so that the golden rule can be rewritten exactly as a single matrix element μ ð1Þ ðωÞ ¼ À 1 π Im ⟨cjd Gðr, r 0 , EÞ d 0 jc⟩: ð2:5ÞThis approach turns out to be advantageous for XAS calculations even in perfect crystals, since inelastic losses (i.e., the mean free path) limit the range probed by XAS experiment to clusters typically of order a few hundred atoms about a given absorption site.

Real-Space Multiple-Scattering Theory:
We now briefly summarize the real-space multiple scattering (RSMS) theory used for practical calculations of EXAFS. The starting point of the theory is the separation of the potential into contributions from "scattering potentials" v R localized on each atomic site R,Here v 0 coul is the Hartree potential calculated for the final state in the presence of a core hole, and Σ E ð Þ is the energy-dependent self-energy. With this separation and the approximation of local spherical symmetry at each site, the propagator is also separableso that the expression for the XAS can be reduced to a calculation of atomic-like dipole-matrix elements M L ¼ c E Á r j jLR h iand matrix elements of G r; r 0 ; E ð Þ.where L ¼ l; m ð Þdenotes the angular momentum variables at each site R. Here and elsewhere we interchangeably use either the photoelectron energy E or the photon frequency ω to characterize the photoelectron energy. Interestingly, the relativistic generalization, which is needed for heavy atoms like PtIn RSMS, the propagator G LL 0 E ð Þ naturally separates into intra-atomic contributions from the central atom G c and multiple scattering contributions from the environment G sc , so that G ¼ G c þ G sc . Consequently, the XAS μ naturally factors aswhere χ is the X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). Thus the net structure in the XAS μ depends both on the atomic background μ 0 ω ð Þand on the fine structure χ due to MS: χ ¼ Im Tr m G sc LL 0 . Since μ 0 ω ð Þ varies weakly with energy, these results are consistent with the experimental definition of the normalized XAFS χ ¼ μ À μ 0 ð Þ=Δμ 0 , where Δμ 0 is the jump in the atomic background absorption at threshold. Formally, the matrix G LL 0 E ð Þ can also be expressed as a sum over all MS paths that a photoelectron can take away from the absorbing atom and backwhere the successive terms represent single, double, . . . scattering processes and δ and δ 0 are partial-wave phase shifts. As noted above, this expansion converges rapidly for EXAFS with of order 10 2 paths. Remarkably, the sum sometimes converges adequately in XANES, particularly in cases with a short core-hole lifetime as in deep core levels in heavy elements. However, the path expansion is not always reliable near the edge, as discussed in Sect. 2.2. Due to the large dimension of G LR, L 0 R 0 E ð Þ, exact calculations with the path expansion can only be carried out for very few low-order MS paths

Mean Free Path:
Two of the crucial differences between ground state electronic structure and excited states in core-level spectra are (1) the need for an energy dependent selfenergy Σ E ð Þ instead of an exchange-correlation functional like DFT, and (2) the need for a screened core-hole. The self-energy is essentially a dynamically screened Hartree-Fock exchange interaction, and is the analog of the exchange-correlation potential V xc of DFT. The real part of the self-energy varies by about 10 eV over XAS energies, slowly turning off in the classical limit, while the imaginary part is negative and varies by about 5 eV. The imaginary part accounts for (extrinsic) inelastic losses or final-state broadening, and can be expressed in terms of a mean free path and a core-hole lifetime Γ, λ ¼ k= Im Σ j jþ Γ ½ : ð2:11ÞThe real part of Σ E ð Þ accounts for systematic shifts in peak positions compared to those calculated with DFT, leading to a stretching of the energy scale at low energies of about 10 %. One of the key developments in practical XAS codes is an efficient algorithm for calculations of Σ E ð Þ based on the GW approximation of Hedin

Many-Body Amplitude Reduction Factor S 2 0:
The effect of the convolution in the exact expression for the XAS in Eq.Since the atomic absorption μ 0 is smoothly varying, the average μ 0 h i % μ 0 has little effect. Here χ R $ Im exp 2ikr ð Þ ½ is the XAFS contribution for a given path. Then, averaging χ R over the quasi-particle peak gives rise to a damping factor exp À2R=λ k ð Þfrom the mean free path, while the broad structure in the spectral function gives an additional factor denoted by S 2 0 , which turns out to be only weakly dependent on R. Physically the mean free path term is dominated by the extrinsic losses, while S 2 0 is dominated by intrinsic losses. A more detailed analysis shows that this factorization is most appropriate at high energies in the EXAFS regime. Near the edge, one expects interference terms to suppress these effects and hence the energy dependence of these contributions to be important.

Thermal Vibrations and XAFS Debye-Waller Factors:
The effects of thermal and structural disorder lead to strong exponential damping of the fine structure, and thus are of crucial importance in XAFS. This damping is dominated by an XAFS Debye-Waller factor exp À2σ 2 k 2 À Á , where σ 2 is the mean square relative displacement (MSRD) of the near-neighbor bonds, and typically varies inversely with the local bond strength. Higher moments of the pair distribution function are sometimes important, especially in temperature dependent investigations of XAS. One of the key theoretical developments in the theory of vibrational damping in XAFS is the cumulant expansion, which yields an efficient parameterization of such thermal and configurational disorderwhich contributes both to the amplitude and phase of the XAFS.The thermal contributions to σ 2 often can be fit to a correlated Debye modelRelations between the cumulants have been derived

Basic Interpretation of XANES:
As discussed in the previous section, the formal theories of XANES and EXAFS are essentially the same, and are both given by Fermi's golden rule, i.e., μ ω ð Þ $ X, where j0i and jFi are many-body initial and final electronic states. When an effective single-particle description of the spectrum is reasonable, this leads towhere ii denotes the core orbital in question, f i are unoccupied single-particle states, and d ¼ Ẽ Á r is the dipole operator. The basic interpretation of this equation is that the core-level electron is kicked out of the core-level by the photon (dipole transition operator) and into an unoccupied excited state of energy ε f ¼ ε c þ ω; as required by energy conservation. The deep core electrons are very nearly angular momentum eigenstates, e.g., the K-edge is a transition from a 1s orbital. This fact, coupled with the dipole selection rule l ! l AE 1; provides an interpretation of the spectrum in terms of the angular momentum projected density of states (LDOS) and smoothly varying transition matrix elements. For example, transitions from a 1s core-level are related to the p-DOS of the system, while transitions from a 2p corelevel are related to the s-DOS and the d-DOS. In many cases the latter dominates and the spectrum can be interpreted in terms of the d-DOS alone. Although the dipole approximation is usually very good, there are some systems for which the pre-edge peaks are due to quadrupole transitions. In this case the selection rules are Δl ¼ 0, AE 2; e.g., transitions from the 1s state are related to the s-and d-DOS.

Differences Between XANES and EXAFS:
Several of the approximations appropriate for the EXAFS regime (beyond about ~20-30 eV above the edge) are not valid in the near edge regime, with some of these related to the reduction of the many-body formulation to an effective singleparticle description, as in Eq. (2.13). For example, in highly correlated systems such as transition metal oxides and f-electron systems, many-body effects can change the qualitative behavior of the near edge spectrumEXAFS is also less sensitive to the non-spherical details of the potentials, and a simple overlapped atomic muffin tin potential is adequate for most practical calculations. On the other hand, near-edge spectra can be quite sensitive to details of charge transfer and changes in Fermi level due to solid state effects. Thus the use of self-consistent potentials and often non-spherical symmetry are essential for accurate calculations of XANES. Finally, calculations of the single particle Fermi golden rule must be treated differently in the near edge region because the path expansion detailed in Eq. (2.10) often fails to converge (or converges very slowly) for low energy photoelectrons. This slow convergence is caused by two factors. First, the inelastic mean free path becomes large for low energy electrons so that very long paths must be included in the expansion. Second, large angle scattering amplitudes are not small at low energies, so that the XANES signal is not dominated by nearly linear scattering paths, and all multiple scattering paths must be taken into account.

Full Multiple Scattering:
Although the path expansion method of calculation is not appropriate for the XANES, one can instead sum the expansion to all orders for any finite cluster of atoms via matrix inversion, so that instead of Eq. (2.10) we haveThe matrices in this equation are represented in a site and angular momentum basis jL, Ri, so the rank of the matrix to be inverted iswhere N is the number of atoms in the cluster, and l is the maximum angular momentum of an expansion in spherical harmonics. Matrix inversion can be expensive computationally for large matrices, since the time to invert scales like the cube of the rank of the matrix. Therefore, practical calculations must limit the cluster size and truncate the sum over angular momentum states. The cluster size cannot be too large, typically ~1000 atoms or less for most computations. Fortunately, one does not usually need such large clusters for XANES calculations since the finite core-hole lifetime keeps the inelastic mean free path from becoming too large. In addition, reasonable accuracy requires that l max is of order k max R mt þ l occ ; where l occ is the largest angular momentum of the occupied states and k 2  max $ E max in Rydberg units. Thus, in the XANES region one can safely set the maximum angular momentum to 4 at most, while at higher energies in the EXAFS matrix inversion becomes impractical. In the intermediate energy regime, Lanczos techniques can be used. In addition, the Green's function G(E) is parameterized by the energy of the photoelectron, thus one inversion must be performed for each energy point in the spectrum. This makes the calculations parallelize naturally and can be done very efficiently on parallel computers

Self-Consistent Potentials:
The Green's function can also be used to calculate the total electron density, i.e.,Thus the Green's function naturally replaces all the orbitals used in standard density functional theory codes, and the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian can be solved selfconsistently using the Green's function1. Atomic Dirac-Fock eigenfunctions and densities are calculated for each type of atom, and an overlapped atom approximation to the density is used as the initial guess in the self-consistency loop. 2. The density and exchange correlation functional is used to create a Kohn-Sham (LDA) potential. 3. The spherical muffin-tin approximation is applied. 4. The Green's function is calculated at each energy using a scattering state basis.6. New densities are calculated from the new Green's function and chemical potential. 7. Steps 2-6 are repeated until the output density is sufficiently close to the input density.FigureSelf-consistency of the densities and potentials can be very important for XANES calculations. For example, if an initial guess of the Fermi energy is too high, pre-edge peaks are missing. Self-consistency and the shift in the Fermi energy due to solid state effects also play a role in chemical shifts, and are very important in systems with multiple, physically unique absorbing sites, such as nanoparticles on a support.where G is the electron Green's function and W ¼ E À1 v, is the screened Coulomb interaction. In the interest of retaining the efficiency of the plasmon pole model, we have developed a many-pole model self-energy which uses multiple poles to represent the loss function L q; ω ð Þ ¼ ÀIm E À1 q, ωÞ ð ½The dispersion of the excitations is approximated by4 which retains the high momentum transfer limitIn this way the model is consistent with the inverse and first moments of the spectrum for any number of poles, and thus convergence with number of poles is relatively fast. Given this model of the dielectric function, the total self-energy can be expressed as a sum of single plasmon pole self-energies arising from interactions with "plasmons" at different frequencies, i.e.,This model has been shown to produce reasonably accurate quasiparticle self-energies in comparison with more accurate, but much more time consuming calculations. The many pole model self-energy has been applied to a variety of systems and gives improved results for amplitudes and phases in XANES calculations using FEFF. The model can also be applied in a post processing step as a convolution of the spectrum with an energy dependent LorentzianIn addition to quasiparticle energies, we can also calculate the inelastic mean free path (IMFP)Multi-electron excitations can also be calculated given the quasiparticle selfenergy, via a convolution of the spectrum with an effective spectral function as in Eq. (2.3)

Information in XANES: Atomic and Electronic Structure:
XANES can be used to probe a variety of properties, including local electronic and chemical structure, atomic structure, and sometimes vibrational properties. For example, L 2,3 -edges of transition metals can be related to the number of holes in the d-orbitals

Use of Configurational Averaging for Vibrational and Static Disorder:
For complicated systems such as amorphous materials or systems at higher temperatures, the EXAFS can be calculated via Debye-Waller factors which damp each path at high k. The XANES is more difficult, since changes in symmetry can Fig.allow previously forbidden transitions, resulting in new peaks in the spectrum. Thus a more accurate method for calculating XANES is to perform averaging over physically unique absorbing sites. This configurational averaging must be performed even when disorder is not present if the system in question has more than one physically unique absorber. For example, magnetite has both tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated iron atoms, thus one calculation should be performed for each of these sites, and the final signal obtained from weighted average of the calculated results, where the weighting depends on the site stoichiometry. Doped systems can also require this kind of configurational averaging if the doping concentration is high. Also, in nanoparticles there can be a large number of physically unique sites, based on the proximity to the surface of the particle, interaction with the support, and interaction with adsorbed molecules. All of these effects cause distortions, which ideally should be modeled along with the dynamic, temperature dependent effects. This can be done using, for example, ab initio molecular dynamics to obtain snapshots of the structure of the system2.2.8 Other Spectroscopies: EELS, XES, NRIXS, RIXS, Compton, etc.Many other spectroscopies are related to XAS as they involve similar physics and an analogous golden rule formalism. In particular, electron energy loss (EELS), X-ray emission (XES), and non-resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (NRIXS) are all similar to XAS, the main difference being that they probe different states, either because the transition operator is different, as in EELS and NRIXS, or because the initial and final states are different, as in XES. XES is particularly useful since it probes the occupied states of the system via the dipole operator, and is thus complementary to XASwhere μ XES is the XES spectrum, μ is the effective XAS spectrum, and E b and Γ b are the core level energy and broadening corresponding to the initial (deep core) excitation, respectively. This formula can be used to estimate both core to core resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, core-valence RXES, and high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) XAS. Finally, Compton scattering can be calculated within the impulse approximation from the density matrix, ρ r; r 0 ð Þ¼À1=π, making multiple scattering a natural formalism for these calculations

Analysis of EXAFS and XANES:
The analysis of EXAFS and XANES begins with a good quality experimental spectrum, and at least some understanding of the physical and chemical environment of the sample that gave that spectrum. Because EXAFS can be measured in a number of modes, and over a wide range of sample conditions and concentration of the absorbing element, care must be taken to ensure that the spectrum being analyzed has been corrected for systematic measurement errors such as overabsorption effects

Data Reduction:
For all XAFS data, whether measured in transmission or emission mode, the data reduction and analysis are essentially the same. First, the measured intensity signals are converted to μ(E), normalized to unity edge jump, and then reduced to χ(k). Normalized μ(E) is suitable for XANES analysis, while EXAFS modeling using the EXAFS equation requires background-subtracted χ(k). In this section, we go through these steps of data reduction in some detail.For transmission measurements, the Beer-Lambert lawð2:19Þ can be used to convert measured intensities to a quantity proportional to the absorption coefficient, μ(E). Here I 0 is the X-ray intensity incident on a sample, I is the X-ray intensity transmitted through the sample, and t is the sample thickness. This can be rearranged (and t ignored as a constant) to giveUsually neither I 0 nor I is an absolute intensity by itself, but signals from ion chambers, photodiodes, or other detectors that are proportional to these intensities. Thus, it is customary to see experimental values reported for "raw" μ(E) in the literature that do not have dimensions of inverse length, but rather are proportional to μ(E) in inverse length. Since the μ(E) will be re-scaled early in the data reduction, this not a problem. For measurements made by detecting emission of the excited atom (including X-ray fluorescence, Auger, and optical luminescence), μ(E) is given aswhere I f is the emitted signal of interest. As with transmission measurements, there is no need to worry about getting absolute intensities, and one can use the ratio of measured intensities.

Pre-edge Subtraction and Normalization:
The experimental μ(E) is reduced to a normalized μ(E), representing the absorption of one X-ray by the element and absorption edge of interest, for both XANES and EXAFS analysis. The resulting normalized μ(E) will have a value near 0 below the edge and be approximately 1 well above the edge. The first step in this process is to identify the edge or threshold energy, E 0 . Since chemical differences can easily move the threshold by several eV, and because calibrations vary between monochromators and beamlines by similar amounts, the most important feature of the E 0 identified at this point is consistency. Though a crude approximation with little theoretical justification, the most common approach is to take the maximum of the first derivative of μ(E). This is easily reproduced, and readily applied to any spectrum, but may require refinement during fitting of the EXAFS. Instrumental drifts from detectors and the expected E À3 dependence of μ(E) can be approximated by a polynomial dependence of μ(E). As a first approximation, a simple linear fit to the pre-edge range of the spectrum can be extrapolated and subtracted from the full spectrum. A slightly better approximation is to fit to the so-called Victoreen pre-edge function, E n μ(E), where n is typically 1, 2 or 3. This is especially helpful for data measured in fluorescence with a solid-state detector for dilute species, where elastic and Compton-scattered X-ray intensity can leak into the energy window of the fluorescence peak of interest, and where this leakage decays as the incident energy increases.Finally, the edge step Δμ is found, and the pre-edge subtracted μ(E) is divided by this value. Typically, a low-order polynomial is fit to μ(E) well above the edge (so as to avoid the XANES region), and the value of this polynomial is extrapolated to E 0 to give the edge step. It should be emphasized that this convention is fairly crude and can introduce systematic biases in the result for Δμ.These steps are illustrated in Fig.

Background Subtraction:
In order to model the EXAFS with equation Eq. (2.2), the EXAFS χ(k) must be separated from the absorption coefficient, usingHere, μ 0 (E) represents the absorption coefficient of the absorbing atom without photoelectron scattering from the neighboring atoms, and Δμ 0 is the edge step. Since μ 0 (E) cannot be measured readily (if at all), it is approximated mathematically. Usually a piece-wise polynomial or spline is used for μ 0 (E). While an ad hoc approach, and capable of being abused, this can be made robust with a small amount of care. The main challenge is to decide how flexible the spline should be, so as to ensure that it does not follow μ(E) closely enough to remove the EXAFS. That is, μ 0 (E) should follow the slowly varying parts of μ(E) but not χ(E), which varies more quickly with E.A simple approach that works well for most cases relies on the Fourier transform to mathematically express this idea that μ 0 (E) should match the slowly varying parts of μ(E) but not the quickly varying parts of μ(E). The Fourier transform is critical to EXAFS analysis, and will be discussed in more detail shortly, but for now the most important point is that it gives a weight for each frequency making up a waveform. The EXAFS Fourier transform converts χ from wavenumber k to distance R.For determining the background μ 0 (E), the spline function should remove the low-R components of χ, while retaining the high-R components. Conveniently, distinguishing "low-R" from "high-R" can be made physically meaningful using the approximate distance to the nearest neighboring atom. As a realistic rule of thumb, Fig.

EXAFS Fourier Transforms:
The Fourier transform is central to the understanding and modeling of EXAFS data. While many resources describe Fourier transforms and their properties, a few important points about the use of Fourier transforms for EXAFS are made here. FigureIn Fig.. For most systems involving single-scattering, Φ k ð Þ $ Àk is a Fig.Prior to the transform, χ(k) is usually multiplied by a power of k, typically k 2 or k 3 , as shown in Fig.In many analyses, the inverse Fourier transform is used to select a particular R range and transform this back to k space, filtering out most of the spectrum and leaving only a narrow band of R values in the resulting filtered χ(k). This can isolate the EXAFS signal for a single shell of physical atoms around the absorbing atom, and was the basis of most early EXAFS analyses. This approach should be used with caution since, for all but the simplest of systems, it can be surprisingly difficult to effectively isolate the EXAFS contribution from an individual scattering atom Fig.

XAFS Data Modeling:
The FeO data shown above is convenient to illustrate many aspects of EXAFS data modeling. FeO has a simple rock salt structure, with Fe surrounded by 6 O, with octahedral symmetry, and then 12 Fe atoms in the next shell. Starting with this simple structure, the scattering amplitudes f eff (k) and phase-shifts Φ(k) can be calculated theoretically using the FEFF formalism described above. These theoretical scattering factors (along with a calculation of the mean free path λ k ) can be used in the EXAFS equation to refine structural parameters R, N, and σ 2 to match a set of data. Typically, E 0 (the energy for which k ¼ 0) is also adjusted to best match data, to compensate for the crude estimate made in the initial processing. While one can do the refinement with the measured χ(k), working with the complex χ(R) is generally preferred, as higher coordination shells can be selectively ignored. The examples shown here are done with the FEFF6

Running and Using FEFF for EXAFS Calculations:
In order to calculate the f eff (k) and Φ(k) needed for the analysis, the FEFF program

First-Shell Fitting:
To model the first shell EXAFS of FeO, a simulation of the EXAFS for the Fe-O scattering path is calculated by FEFF from a cluster derived from the known crystal parameters for FeO. Setting S 2 0 to 0.75, values for N, R, σ 2 , and E 0 are refined until the model for χ best matches the complex χ(R) of the measured data. The results of this refinement are shown in Fig.It is instructive to look at this refinement more closely and discuss a few details. The refinement was done on the χ(R) data, after a Fourier transform of k 2 χ(k)Ω(k) for both data and model, where Ω(k) represents a Hanning window with a range between k ¼ 2:5, 13:5 ½ Å À1 , and with a dk parameter of 2 Å À1 . Both real and imaginary components of χ(R) between R ¼ 1:0, 2:0 ½ Å were used. FigureThe refinement used a nonlinear least-squares fit to minimize a standard statistical definition for the chi-square statistic where y data i is the experimental data, y model i (x) is the model constructed from the EXAFS equation and the variable fitting parameters x, ε is uncertainty in the data, and N data is the number of points being fit. As mentioned above, the real and imaginary components of χ(R) were used as y for both data and model, though fitting to k 2 χ(k) data is not uncommon. A crude estimate of ε can be made from the high frequency noise in χ(k)where Δk and ΔR are the range of useful data in k and R. For the first shell of FeO with k ¼ 2:5; 13:5 ½ Å À1 and R ¼ 1:0; 2:0 ½ Å, this gives N ind % 8. The number of variables in a fit should not exceed this value.

Second-Shell Fitting:
Including the second shell in the model for the FeO EXAFS involves adding the path for Fe-Fe scattering to the sum in the EXAFS equation. Variables for R, N, and σ 2 for the Fe-Fe shell will be included, while a single value for E 0 will be used for both the Fe-O and Fe-Fe paths. The fit range will be extended to R ¼ 1:0, 3:1 ½ Å, increasing N ind to % 15:7, while the number of variables increases to 7. Results for this fit are shown Fig.

XANES Analysis:
As discussed in Sect. 2.2.6, XANES is uniquely sensitive to oxidation state, coordination chemistry, and the partial density of unoccupied electronic states, and XANES spectra are much richer in spectral features than EXAFS, making it an excellent spectroscopic technique for almost every elementAlthough the XANES cannot be numerically parameterized in terms of oxidation state or coordination chemistry, these can be determined using simpler spectroscopic analysis methods. For example, the pre-edge peaks in the K and L edges of 3d metal are very rich at identifying coordination chemistry and hybridization of electronic levels, even if the precise intensities of the different transitions is complicated to calculate accurately. To make analysis quantitative, fitted intensities of such peaks can be compared to calibration curves made from spectra of known materials. While such analysis is not ab initio, it can be robust and reliable with minimal effort. As an illustration of such XANES peak analysis, the left-hand side of Fig.A second common approach to XANES analysis is to treat the spectra as a signature or fingerprint of a material, and determine the fractional composition of ½ eV. The fit used three Voigt peaks (blue, solid) and an error function (blue, dashed). The fit residual (black), has been multiplied by 10, and offset. Right: XANES fit of an unknown Au LIII-edge spectrum to a linear combination of spectra from model compounds (gold chloride, metal, and sulfide), with contributions of individual components (blue) and the fit residual.

Introduction:
The great success of EXAFS and XANES stems from the insights they provide into the atomic and electronic structure of complex materials. This has been especially important for catalytic systems, as discussed elsewhere in this volume. As shown in the previous sections, this success was aided in part by the development of robust theoretical methods to simulate a broad range of X-ray spectroscopies

Use of Modeling to Enhance EXAFS Analysis:
While the fitting of EXAFS spectra using theoretical scattering amplitudes and phase-shifts is now a well-established methodology, the calculation of other parameters of the EXAFS equation, Eq. (2.2), such as path lengths, number of near-neighbors N R and mean-square relative displacements (MSRD) σ 2 R have only recently become feasible on a routine basis. While many theoretical methods lack the accuracy needed to rival fitted EXAFS path lengths, they may be well suited to distinguish between alternative conformations, and provide good approximations to both the N R and σ 2 R , thus making the fitting of the path lengths much more reliable in many complicated materials. In this section we discuss two ways in which theoretical modeling can enhance EXAFS fits: First, we focus on the calculation of ab initio Debye-Waller factors for systems where σ 2 R can be described well using a combination of static and vibrational disorder. Second, we highlight the simulation of EXAFS spectra for systems with large dynamic disorder.

Ab Initio Debye-Waller Factors:
The theory behind MSRDs or XAFS Debye-Waller factors and how to compute them ab initio is now fairly well establishedwhere R and R are the instantaneous and mean path lengths, respectively. In the quasi-harmonic approximation, the average can be computed as a sum over vibrational or phonon eigenmodeswhere μ R is the reduced mass for path R. Poiarkova and RehrHere j0i is a vector representing a normalized mass-weighted displacement of the atoms along the multiple-scattering path R. Efficient calculations of the lattice dynamical Green's function can be accomplished using a continued fraction representation obtained with the iterative Lanczos algorithm that yields an N-pole representation for the VDOS where ω ν and w ν are, respectively, the pole frequencies and weights of pole v. D, the dynamical matrix of force constants, or Hessian, is the main ingredient required for the calculation of theoretical MSRDs and is defined as:∂u jlα ∂u j 0 l 0 β ; ð2:28Þwhere u jlα and M j are the α ¼ x; y; z f gCartesian displacement and mass of atom j in unit cell l, respectively, and E is the internal energy of the system. For molecular systems, D is routinely computed with quantum chemistry packages like GaussianThe agreement for the MSRDs (σ 2 ) is quite good and, given the error margins from the EXAFS fit, could be used "as is" in the EXAFS fit to replace the fitted values. In particular, the theoretical results provide a good alternative for the weaker bonds, where the EXAFS-fitted values have large uncertainties.In practice, however, a better approach may be to set up a fitting model where the near-neighbor MSRDs are scaled by a single parameter. This approach is quite useful for systems with mixed coordination shells with different MSRDs where the number of EXAFS parameters becomes large and highly correlated.

Simulating EXAFS of Dynamic Systems:
The standard approach to vibrational disorder in EXAFS assumes that the local environment surrounding the absorbing atom is relatively rigid, with small distortions that are harmonic, thus resulting in an approximately Gaussian pair distribution function

Use of Modeling to Enhance XANES Analysis:
The theoretical modeling of XANES spectra poses bigger challenges than that of EXAFS due to two main reasons: (a) It demands more computationally intensive simulations and, (b) generally there is incomplete information about the structure of the system under study. These two aspects result in the need for theoretical generation of structural models by means of optimizations or MD simulations. As in the case of EXAFS, the former are quite useful for quasi-rigid systems, while the latter are required for systems with dynamic fluctuations and bond-breaking. As opposed to EXAFS, XANES spectra are often less sensitive to the quality of the structural model, thus permitting the direct use of theoretical structures in the simulations. The advent of accurate and efficient DFT simulations has virtually eliminated the need to guess possible structures since one can now optimize accurate models based on simple external information such as composition

Effects of Dynamical Disorder on XANES:
As in the case of EXAFS, dynamic structural disorder plays a very important role in the accurate simulation of XANESThe effects of the dynamic disorder on the XANES are very significant. Figure

Understanding Electronic Structure Changes Through Modeling:
Perhaps one of the most useful features of theoretical modeling is the possibility of directly visualizing atomistic changes in electron density distribution. This is particularly important since global probes such as EXAFS and XANES reveal the ensemble characteristics of materials while missing details of their internal structure. Moreover, changes in spectral features such as edge position and white line intensity that are commonly associated with charge density fluctuations in a qualitative way can be studied quantitatively and in detail. An excellent example of the atomistic understanding that is gained through modeling arises again in the case of Pt 10 on γ-Al 2 O 3

Synchrotron-Radiation Sources:
A synchrotron radiation (SR) source is one of the best light sources for XAFS measurements, which need an intense energy-tunable X-ray source with a wide range. Two types of SR sources are available: a storage ring and a linear accelerator. Sects. 3.1-3.3 describe the storage-ring source and associated beamlines. Chapter 4 describes an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) as an advanced linearaccelerator source.

Bending-Magnet Source:
The main characteristics of SR light emitted from a storage ring are high brightness, a very wide and continuous spectral range, high directionality, variable polarity, and a pulsed time structureA schematic drawing of a storage ring is shown in Fig.where c is the speed of light, and v, m 0 , and E are the speed, rest mass, and energy of the electron, respectively. In the case of E ¼ 8 GeV, γ À1 ¼ 6:4 Â 10 À5 rad, which indicates the BM radiation is highly directional in the vertical direction. On the other hand, the BM radiation is emitted along a curved electron obit, so its opening angle in the horizontal direction is determined by a slit opening installed in the downstream section and is typically in the order of milliradians (Fig.where R is the radius of the electron orbit, and B 0 is the magnetic flux density of the BM. In the case of SPring-8 (E ¼ 8 GeV, B 0 ¼ 0.679 T), E c ¼ 28:9 keV. The maximum energy applicable to XAFS measurements is about three to four times E c , which is higher than 100 keV at SPring-8.

Insertion-Device Sources:
An insertion device (ID) consists of a linearly arranged periodic magnet array (Fig.where λ u is the period length of the magnet, and K is defined by K is called the K-parameter (or deflection parameter) and determines the maximum deflection angle of the electron, Kγ À1 . The characteristics of the radiation emitted by the ID strongly depend on the value of K, which can be controlled by the magnetic-field strength. Accordingly, two types of ID are available: wiggler (K ) 1) and undulator (K ≲ 1).In the case of the undulator, the electron beam wiggles with a deflection angle close to or smaller than the photon natural emission angle, γ À1 . In the case of K ( 1, the radiation emitted by the same electron beam at each period of the magnetic field interferes. The amplitude of the emitted radiation thus add up coherently, thereby increasing the radiation intensity N 2 -fold (three to four orders) higher than the BM radiation (where N is the number of periods). The observed electromagnetic field of the radiation is close to a sinusoidal wave of the same period as that of the magnet; therefore, the spectrum obtained by its Fourier transform is monochromatic. In the case of K ~1, only the radiation emitted at a deflection angle smaller than γ À1 can be observed. Accordingly, the observed electromagnetic field is a modified sinusoidal wave, and the spectrum consists of harmonics as shown in Fig.E n can be controlled by the magnet gap of the undulator. When narrowing the magnet gap, K increases in proportional to B 0 (Eq. 3.4), and then E n decreases. The energy bandwidth of the undulator radiation, ΔE/E is usually 2-3 %. ΔE is a few-hundred electronvolts at 10 keV, which is adequate for XANES measurement but not for EXAFS measurement.The Quick EXAFS and energy-dispersive EXAFS measurements presented in Sect. 10.1 and Chap. 11 need energy bandwidth wider than 1 keV. A tapered undulator was thus developed to adjust the energy bandwidth by tuning the taper of the gap of the magnet array (see Sect. 10.1). The coherency of the undulator radiation, however, decreases due to the disturbed magnetic-field periodicity.In the wiggler, the electron beam wiggles with a large deviation angle, so only the radiation emitted at poles can be observed. The radiation intensities, not amplitudes, add up, thereby increasing the radiation intensity N-fold (a multi-pole wiggler). The observed electromagnetic field is a periodic positive-and-negative pulse train, so the spectrum is similar to that of BM (Fig.The characteristics of the SR light mentioned above correspond to the case of an ideal electron beam in the ring. The actual electrons run in groups and have a finite spatial, angular, and energy spread, which influence the characteristics of the SR light. In the accumulation ring, a specific number of the electron population (bunch) runs at specific time intervals. A pulsed SR light is emitted at this time interval. Filling patterns of the electron bunch (Fig.

X-Ray Optics:
The XAFS measurement is conducted by measuring X-ray absorption accurately at X-ray energies around the absorption edge of the target element. The requirements for measuring high-quality XAFS spectra are narrow X-ray-energy bandwidth (high energy resolution), low harmonic X-rays contaminant incident on the sample, adequate beam size for the measurement, a stable and low-noise measurement system, and a homogeneous sample. Most XAFS beamlines are constructed with the aim of satisfying the first four requirements. In many cases, the quality of the spectra is determined by sample preparation. The beamline design required for accurate XAFS measurement is described in the following sections.SR beamlines consist of a light source, a front end section, an optics hutch, and experimental hutches (Fig.

Monochromator:
The monochromator diffracts monochromatic X-rays of selected energy by adjusting the inclination angle of the net plane of the crystal (the angle of diffraction), θ B , according to Bragg's low (Eq. 3.6)where d is lattice spacing of the crystal (d-spacing). A single crystal silicon has been most widely used for the monochromator crystal, since it has excellent characteristics, such as good crystal perfection, good thermal property, and large crystal size.The energy bandwidth (energy resolution) of the diffracted beam is calculated from Eq. (3.6) and given bywhere Δθ D is intrinsic diffraction width of the crystal, and Δθ I is divergence angle of the incident beam. To achieve high energy resolution, both Δθ D and Δθ I have to be small. Higher-order net planes have smaller Δθ D and realize higher energy resolution, but lower diffracted-beam intensity. Many XAFS beamlines operated in the hard-X-ray region use Si(1 1 1) crystal based on the diffracted-beam intensity with ΔE/E ≲ 2 Â 10 À4 . X-ay beam position must be kept fixed on the sample during XAFS scan. Accordingly, a conventional XAFS monochromator uses double crystals in parallel arrangement (double crystal monochromator, DCM) (Fig.To cover a wide energy range, switching mechanisms of multiple crystal pairs or net planes of the crystal are installed. The first crystal is usually mounted on a metal block cooled by water or liquid nitrogen to withstand the heat load of the SR.

Mirror:
An X-ray mirror utilizes the total reflection by a material surface. At the interface of a vacuum and a material with refractive index n, the critical angle of total reflection, θ c , is deduced by Snell's law, given byIn the case of neglecting an absorption factor,where ρ is the weight density of the material (g/cm 3 ). In the hard X-ray region, δ is 10 À4 -10 À5 , so θ c is 1-10 mrad. Thus, the mirror should be long to accept the SR light, such as 1 m. The critical energy of the mirror at the mirror glancing angle of θ i is given byThe surface of the mirror substrate, such as SiO 2 and Si, is highly polished for high reflectivity and coated with high-weight-density materials, such as platinum (ρ ¼ 21.4 g/cm 3 ) and rhodium (ρ ¼ 12.4 g/cm 3 ). In the XAFS beamline, rhodium is usually used because platinum L-absorption edges disturb the XAFS spectra from The mirror is used mainly for three purposes: focusing, collimation, and higherenergy rejection. The mirror surface for focusing and collimation is shaped as a one-or two-dimensional figured shape. A toroidal mirror for two-dimensional focusing is shown in Fig.where p and q are distances from source to mirror and from mirror to focus, respectively. In the case of a collimation mirror, q ¼ 1. In the case of a hard-Xray conventional mirror, p ¼ 15 À 50 m, q ¼ 5 À 20 m, and θ i ¼ 1 À 10 mad, so R m ¼ 0:1 À 10 km and R s ¼ 30 À 100 mm. In the case of an XAFS beamline, rejection of the higher harmonics diffracted by the monochromator is the most important requirement. Two methods are applied to meet this requirement. One is to detune the parallelism of the double crystal of the monochromator so as to reduce the diffracted beam flux of higher harmonics due to the difference of intrinsic diffraction width. The other is to use the critical energy of the mirror. A double mirror effectively and stably reduces the higher harmonics to less than 10 À4 . The beamline and its optics are described in the next sections.

Bending Magnet and Wiggler Beamline:
The designs of the BM and wiggler beamlines are similar, since their spectral shapes are almost the same. The schematic layout of the main optics in BM beamline BL01B1 at SPring-8, which is dedicated to conventional XAFS measurement in a wide energy range, is shown in Fig.In the BM beamline, the horizontal beam width at the mirror is more than several tens millimeters. Accordingly, a vertical reflecting (pseudo) toroidal mirror is often used for accepting a wide beam and conducting two-dimensional focusing at the sample.

Undulator Beamline:
An undulator XAFS beamline has the following features differing from those of a BM or wiggler beamline. First, the beam divergence, both in the vertical and horizontal directions, is quite small, enabling the monochromator and mirror to take both vertical and horizontal deflection geometries. The beam divergence in the vertical direction is close to the slope error of the mirror surface, so a collimation mirror is not needed. A stripe-coat mirror can be used to switch coating materials, such as platinum and rhodium. Second, the beam power density is quite high. In most cases, the first crystal of the DCM is cooled by liquid nitrogen. Third, the undulator gap is tuned at each measurement point in synchronization with the Bragg angle of the monochromator crystal, since the energy bandwidth of the undulator radiation is narrow. Fourth, the source size and divergence is small and useful for formation of a high-flux-density micro/nano X-ray beam by using focusing optics, such as a Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror and a Fresnel zone plate (described in Chap. 13).The undulator beam has many advantages regarding beam quality (as mentioned above), which is indispensable for advanced XAFS measurements, such as fast time-resolved XAFS, micro/nano XAFS using a focused beam, polarized XAFS, and high energy resolution XAFS (described in Part 4). Most conventional XAFS measurements, however, do not need a high-quality undulator beam. In some cases, sample damage due to intense undulator X-ray beam irradiation is a serious problem.Chapter 4

Makina Yabashi and Tetsuo Katayama:
The twenty-first century saw the arrival of an exciting new light source, X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs). XFELs generate ultra-brilliant, coherent, and femtosecond X-ray pulses. X-ray spectroscopy is one of the most promising applications using XFEL, allowing one to directly probe ultrafast changes in electronic states and geometric structures during real chemical reactions at angstrom and femtosecond resolution using X-ray absorption and/or emission measurements.In 2009, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in the USA generated the first FEL light in the hard X-ray region based on a self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) schemeFor performing X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments using an XFEL source, one can consider two complementary schemes: a wavelength scanning method and a dispersive method, similar to those used in synchrotron light sources. The former method, combined with fluorescence detection, provides a high sensitivity to small changes of X-ray absorbance in shallow volumes interacting with optical lasersX-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) is also a powerful technique to understand the charge and spin dynamics in the femtosecond regime. For this purpose, a dispersive scheme in a von Hamos geometry is preferable for detecting the whole emission spectrum

Transmission Measurement:
XAFS spectra are measured in several modes such as transmission, fluorescence, and electron yield. Transmission mode is the basic of XAFS and is usually used to rather concentrated samples. The experimental setup is very simple as shown in Fig.Ripples in high voltage power supply used to apply electric field become a source of noise, and thus very low noise power supply is required. The surface of insulators used in ionization chamber should be kept clean and dry since leakage current also becomes the origin of noise. Output current from an ionization chamber is sent to a fast current amplifier, the output voltage from it is converted to digital signal by using Analog-to-Digital converter (ADC) or a pair of Voltage-to-Frequency (V/F) converter and a scaler (pulse counter). The longer the time constant of the current amplifier, the smaller the noise. Thus, it should be carefully selected, especially when quick scanning XAFS is used.Preparing uniform sample with appropriate absorbance is the most important point when measuring XAFS in transmission mode. X-rays pass through the thin part of sample is less absorbed thus gives incorrect μt in totalIf the linearity of the detection system is good, μt signal becomes continuous even before and after beam injection. However, users cannot experience beam injections in recent synchrotron facilities since top-up injection is adopted. In such cases a simple performance test described below becomes useful. When a sample is placed before the entrance slit in place of the usual sample position, there should not appear any absorption edge in the XAFS spectrum. However, sometimes apparent "edge" is observed on the spectrum as shown in Fig.(a) nonlinearity of the detection system, (b) improper offset adjustment of the detection system, (c) significant higher order content in the incoming X-ray beam.

Fluorescence:
When the concentration of the element of interest becomes low (ex. 10 mmol dm À3 Cu aq.), it becomes hard to extract correct χ signal from transmission mode measurements (Fig.Combination of the filter and slit assembly is fairly powerful but cannot remove the scattered X-rays well when the scattered X-ray is much intense than the fluorescent one. In such cases, more powerful detection system is required. When a semiconductor absorbs an X-ray photon, electron-hole pairs are produced. The typical energy to produce it is ca. 3 eV in the case of Ge. Since the produced charge is one order larger than that in ionization chamber, each pulse signal produced by an X-ray photon can be handled separately. In this case, the pulse height of the signal reflects the energy of absorbed X-ray photon, and thus can distinguish the fluorescent signal and scattered one by using analog electronics or digital signal processor. Typical energy resolution (ΔE) is 130-300 eV for 5.9 keV X-ray photon (E) according to the size of the detector and shaping time of signal processing electronics. Pure Ge detector is usually used since it has high detection efficiency even for high energy X-rays and gives fairly good energy resolution

Electron Yield:
Total electron yield mode is often used in soft X-ray region since transmission mode is hard to use and fluorescence yield is rather low and the sample is placed under vacuum in general. The current from a high transmission (ca. 80 %) grid or thin metal foil is used as an I 0 -monitor and that from the sample is used as I signal. Special care should be paid to the selection of materials used for grid or foil since fluorescent X-rays from impurities disturb measurements. When the current is too low, an electron multiplier is used in place of a direct current measurement.Electron yield is also used in hard X-ray region in order to obtain the information from the surface layers (several tens nm). The principle is similar to that of ionization chamber and the ion or electron current emitted from the sample is measured; sample itself is an electrode. Sample cell is filled with He gas so as to minimize the ionization of the fill gas by X-ray. This method is called as Conversion Electron Yield (CEY). If thin aluminized Mylar © is used as a counter electrode and put a fluorescence detector behind it, both FY and CEY XAFS spectra can be measured simultaneously.

Special Detection Modes:
The above described three modes are usually used for XAFS measurements, but some special modes are reported and they may be useful in some special cases. One is to detect X-ray Excited Optical Luminescence (XEOL). In some cases XEOL can be used for site-selective measurements

Chapter 6:
Cell Designs for In Situ and Operando Studies Dmitry E. Doronkin, Henning Lichtenberg, and Jan-Dierk Grunwaldt

Introduction and Criteria for the Choice of an Appropriate Cell:
The design of appropriate spectroscopic cells for in situ and operando XAFS studies of heterogeneous catalysts has been a very active field during the past decades as the investigation of catalysts at work has become a powerful approach to improve the activity and selectivity of catalysts in a rational mannerStill, during the past years a number of new in situ cells have been developed, e.g., to combine XAFS with complementary techniquesMany of these organizations even provide infrastructure and support for the users without synchrotron experience; however, choosing an appropriate cell is a critical decision for a successful experiment.The reasons for the wide variety of in situ cells are manifold. One of the main reasons is the high number of different applications. A spectroscopic cell for studying a catalyst while it is working (e.g., in a fast reaction) needs a completely different design than a cell for a catalyst that acts in a slow reaction which is not mass transfer limited, a reaction in liquid phase or an experiment where the catalyst is studied after reduction. Grunwaldt et al.• Are the data to be collected in transmission or in fluorescence mode? This depends on a number of factors including the nature of the sample (concentration of the element of interest and homogeneity of its distribution in the sample), the experimental design, and the necessity to combine XAFS with other spectroscopic techniques. • The range of the photon energies to be covered. This is crucial for choosing the appropriate material and the thickness of X-ray windows. • Operating temperatures and pressures as well as chemical compatibility of reactants with window, reactor and sealing materials. Maximum heating and cooling ramps, which are limited by the thermal mass of the cell. • In case of catalytic reactions: Is the reaction fast or slow (internal mass transport limitations)? Does it occur in gas phase or liquid or even three-phase mixture (external mass transport limitations)? • Are accurate measurements of catalyst activity, selectivity, and the temperature of the catalyst bed necessary? In particular, will the measurements be carried out under operando conditions? • Are specific safety issues to be considered? • Are spatially or time resolved studies (resolution) required? • Should the XAS experiment be combined with other spectroscopic techniques?Irrespective of the type of the cell an important decision has to be made concerning the X-ray transparent window material. The material has to absorb the minimum amount of incoming, transmitted and/or fluorescence X-rays and needs to be chemically, temperature, and mechanically stable for the desired application. The most commonly used X-ray window materials include beryllium, Kapton ® (polyimide), quartz, glassy carbon, and boron nitride. For high pressure in situ cells and studies at higher photon energies (typically more than 10 keV) foils of light metals, e.g., Al or Ti can serve as X-ray windows. If a combination of techniques is required the window has to be transparent for all used photon energies, e.g., when combining XAS with simultaneous Raman measurements quartz reactorsIn general, a cell design fulfilling all wishes of an experimentalist is rarely possible or available which results in compromises between the XAFS data quality and catalytic performance, easiness of operation, safety, and many more aspects. A comparison of in situ cells of principally different design concepts in terms of both spectral data quality and the relevance for the reaction kinetic (operando) measurements was reported by Grunwaldt et al. (Fig.The reason for different kinetics of Cu reduction is just due to internal mass transfer limitations as demonstrated in ref.the methane concentration drops to less than 10 % at the center of the catalyst particle (L c is a characteristic length defined as half of the thickness for a disk and 1/6 of the particle diameter for round-shaped particles, cf. ref.In conclusion, for fast reactions a finely sieved powder catalyst should preferentially be used. Similar considerations as for gas phase experiments can be made for liquids and higher pressure studies, where also external mass transport limitations at the fluid/solid interface may occur

In Situ Cells for Studies of Catalysts in Form of Powders and Pellets:
One of the first cells for the in situ XAFS studies of catalysts was designed by F. Lytle et al.A much simpler but not less versatile cell was originally suggested by Clausen et al.The remarkable versatility of this design allows simultaneous measurements of X-ray absorption, fluorescence, diffractionFor high throughput X-ray absorption studies (to increase the number of measured catalysts) also a microreactor array was developed that allows to study the structural changes in six to ten solid samples with an independent gas supply to each reactor channel and also fast independent MS analysisApplication of thin walled quartz capillaries limits the maximum pressure and requires several safety precautions against breaking the capillary. Other materials Fig.High pressure studies (>20 bar) require special reactor designs as most of the X-ray window materials cannot withstand such pressure if made thin enough for low absorption of X-rays

In Situ Cell for Studies in Liquid Phase and at Elevated Pressures:
Not all catalytic processes are realized in flow-through reactors. Some liquid-phase reactions and reactions in supercritical fluids require high pressure batch reactors to run

In Situ Cell for Studies of Chemical Sensors:
Sensors are another type of nanomaterials closely related to catalysts in terms of structure and gas-solid interaction (cf. Chap. 25). Therefore, as in catalytic studies, characterization of sensing materials should be carried out in a realistic gas atmosphere and at realistic temperatures. For semiconducting sensors an important difference is for example the sandwich structure of sensors which is typically a sandwich consisting of a sensing material, electrodes, a substrate and heater layersFig.

In Situ Cells for Studies of Electrocatalysts:
Unlike photocatalysts, electrocatalysts require specially developed cells for in situ and operando X-ray studies. The design concept of in situ electrochemical cells often reproduces real fuel cells and is based on a sandwich of electrodes. The anode and cathode are coated with the corresponding electrocatalysts and an ion (proton) conducting membrane. If the electrocatalysts to be studied are based on different metals, the only major modification required to adapt the fuel cell to in situ studies is to provide a thinning to serve as X-ray window

Conclusions and Outlook:
The selected examples show that the combination of XAS and related photon-in/ photon-out techniques with reaction cells operating close to realistic conditions provides a very powerful tool to establish structure-function relationships in catalysis and related areas. An appropriate design of spectroscopic cells is one of the keys to successful in situ and operando XAFS studies in gas and liquid phase or even under challenging high pressure conditions. Criteria which are typically applied in chemical engineering are valuable for an optimization of in situ cells for time-resolved and for operando studies. Reaction cell design will remain a very active field in future as one can only aim for the "best compromise" and the criteria described in this chapter may give a hint how to achieve this goal most rapidly. This will significantly contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of functional materials, in particular the catalyst structure while monitoring the catalytic performance or even the kinetics of catalytic processes.

Introduction:
Time-Resolved XAFS techniques are powerful tools for investigating the local structure and chemical state during physical and chemical reaction processes and have been used worldwide in synchrotron facilities. There are two major techniques: quick scan XAFS (QXAFS) and energy dispersive XAFS (DXAFS). In this section, the QXAFS techniques are described. The DXAFS techniques are described in Chap. 8.The QXAFS technique was developed by Frahm et al.Figure

Measurement Method:
As described above, in the QXAFS measurement, the X-ray intensities and angle of the monochromator crystal are simultaneously measured and temporarily stored in the memory of each measurement system during continuous monochromator scanning (see Fig.When operating the QXAFS measurement system, a user can enter the measurement time for one XAFS spectrum, range, and step of the monochromator scan angle. The angle step is set to correspond to the energy step of the XANES region and transformed to the sampling time by the operation software.The monochromator scan speed is in most systems constant, other than in the acceleration and deceleration periods. In most cases, the amplitude of the EXAFS oscillation is smaller in the higher k-region. Thus, the step scan XAFS measurements are usually conducted with a longer measurement time in the higher k-region to obtain spectra having a better signal to noise ratio. The raw QXAFS data is usually resampled at the points corresponding to constant interval of k, i.e., 0.5 nm -1 , by averaging the data between adjacent sampling points as shown in Fig., where E e is the photoelectron energy, N ave is roughly estimated to be proportional to k, which indicates that the resampled data quality is higher in the higher k-range.Further, a time-efficient QXAFS method was developed to measure higher quality spectra up to high-k regions in the shortest possible time

Characteristics of QXAFS:
In this section, the main characteristics of QXAFS are described and compared with those of DXAFS. First, QXAFS can be conducted in the same mode as those available in step scan XAFS, e.g., transmission mode, fluorescence mode, total conversion electron yield mode, and reflection mode. Thus, QXAFS can be adapted for all samples measured by step scan XAFS, including dilute samples and thin films. Second, QXAFS can be adapted for spatially inhomogeneous samples and samples surrounded by highly scattering materials such as fuel cells as shown in Fig.The time resolution of QXAFS is determined by factors related to hardware, such as scan speed of the monochromator and response time of the detectors and measurement systems, and factors related to the samples themselves, such as the time needed to measure spectra with a high enough quality for the XAFS analysis and to stimulate the reaction of the sample, such as gas diffusion.However, QXAFS does have some disadvantages compared with DXAFS: specifically, a minimum time resolution and the absorbance at each energy point in one spectrum depending on the measurement time.

X-ray Optics at Bending Magnet and Wiggler Beamlines:
At the bending magnet or wiggler beamlines, QXAFS measurements are conducted with the time resolution from seconds to minutes depending on the photon flux. In many beamlines, fixed-exit DCM is used for both the QXAFS and step scan XAFS measurements. The first crystal of the DCM is cooled with water or liquid nitrogen to withstand heat load. There are two types of DCM based on the control method.The first involves conducting a quick scan in keeping with a fixed-exit condition. To achieve a fixed-exit beam, the DCM needs to continuously control the rotation motion of both crystals and the translation motion of the first or second crystal. Mechanical link type DCMs have been developed to achieve this, where the rotation and translation motions are driven using a single motor. A technical challenge of the mechanical link DCM is how to keep the parallelism between both crystals during the translation motion of the first or second crystal. A number of different schemes have been developed to address this. These DCMs consist of a single rotational stage for mounting the double crystals and a translation stage for the first or second crystal.In the other type of DCM method, a quick scan is performed without a fixed-exit condition. In this case, the QXAFS measurements are realized by rotating a pair of DCM crystals without translation motion of the first or second crystal, similar to a channel-cut crystal. The simply designed DCM for the step scan XAFS can be used here. Prior to the QXAFS measurement, the parallelism between both crystals is adjusted by measuring the rocking curve at the center energy of the QXAFS, which enables the stability of the beam flux. The height of the exit beam from the monochromator changes during the QXAFS scan. The downstream vertically focusing mirror, however, can keep the beam height at the sample (focal point) (see Fig.

Undulator Beamline and Optics:
The undulator source enables higher time resolution of the QXAFS due to a higher photon flux on the sample. The energy width of the first harmonic of the undulator is 2-3 %, which corresponds to about 200-300 eV at 10 keV. This is enough for the XANES measurements but unfortunately does not seem to be enough for the EXAFS measurements. There are two ways to conduct the QEXAFS measurement, depending on the undulator gap operation. One is synchronized continuous scans of the undulator gap and the DCMThe other method is conducted with a fixed gap undulator that is either tapered or non-tapered (see Sects. 3.1-3.3). The tapered undulator increases the energy width of the harmonics by varying the taper ratio of the undulator gap. FigureA faster QXAFS measurement system is realized by coupling the tapered undulator with a channel-cut monochromator system. Frahm et al. developed the QEXAFS monochromators based on a cam-driven tilt table for rapid angular oscillations between 0 and 3 mounted on a goniometer which defines the mean energy of the QXAFS spectrumThe low divergent undulator radiation enables channel-cut crystal to be compact, which allows for faster angular oscillation. FigureQXAFS with a milliseconds time resolution was realized by using even faster monochromators. One is the piezo-driven double-crystal monochromator developed by Frahm et al.The other monochromator consists of the channel-cut crystal having a very small inertia. This monochromator was first developed for the helical undulator in BL40XU at SPring-8 which has a non-tapered gap and gives a high flux but low power quasimonochromatic X-ray beamThe galvano scanner motor driven monochromator with no cooling device can also be used for the tapered undulator radiation under certain conditionsIt should be noted that the tapered undulator radiation has a spatial distribution that changes with the energy (Fig.

Detectors:
Almost all X-ray measurement devices used in step scan XAFS can be applied for the QXAFS measurement, but some of them have been improved so as to achieve the faster response required from the high time resolution.For the transmission mode fast QXAFS measurement with the time resolution of less than 1 s, fast response ionization chambers have been developed. One of these, a gridded ionization chamber, suppresses the slow ionic component of the ionization current by placing a metal grid between the electrodes and keeping it at an appropriate electric potentialIn fast fluorescence mode QXAFS measurements less than 1 s, a large area PIN-photodiode (PIN-PD) is used with an applied reverse bias voltage to achieve fast response on the order of micro seconds. It is noted in selecting the PIN-PD model that the larger area PIN-PD has a higher dark current and slower rise time. The Lytle-type detector (EXAFS Co.) is a large area fluorescence detector conventionally used in step scan XAFS. As it has a response time of sub-seconds, it has been used for slow QXAFS measurements with a time resolution of more than minutes. Recently, two dimensional pixel array detectors (PADs) such as PILA-TUS, EIGER (DECTRIS Ltd.), and Merlin (Quantum Detector Ltd.) are starting to be applied. These are hybrid single photon-counting type detectors with a large area and a fast readout time of sub-ms to ms. These features are very useful in terms of application to a high quality fluorescence mode QXAFS detector. They can be used for QXAFS with a time resolution of more than sub-seconds.For the measurement of ultra-dilute samples or thin films, energy dispersive detectors such as Ge detectors or silicon drift detectors (SDDs) are applied. Multielement types are preferable for detection over a large area. The output voltage from the preamplifier of the detectors is amplified, digitalized, and stored in memory by a digital X-ray processor system. These measurement systems have a maximum photon count rate, such as 1 MHz (Ge detector) or 3 MHz (SDD) per element, which restricts time resolution to more than 1 s for the QEXAFS measurement. Figure

Measurement Systems:
Both an ionization chamber and PIN-PD are required to measure very small electric currents with a high speed and high accuracy, which makes such electric measurements quite difficult. The output current of these detectors is amplified to voltage by current amplifiers. The voltage signals are then digitalized and saved to a PC. Two types of system are used for digitalizing voltage signals. One is a set consisting of a voltage-to-frequency converter (VFC) and a frequency counter. This system sums the analog voltage signals measured over a time interval between start and stop trigger, which improves the spectral quality by increasing the statistical accuracy Fig.However, the VFC counter system has a limitation for highly time-resolved measurements due to the maximum frequency of the VFC. The counter rounds frequency output from the VFC to an integer, and the number of counts (not the number of photons) is require to be on the order of 10 3 and 10 6 for the quality analysis of XANES and EXAFS up to k ¼ 100 nm À1 , respectively. The maximum frequency of the now commercially available VFC is 100 MHz. In the QEXAFS measurement, the number of data points is typically about 5000. In the case of QXAFS measurement with the time resolution of 1 s, the data sampling time is 200 μs, so the maximum number of counts at each sampling point is 20,000 using the 100 MHz VFC. After averaging the data process, the estimated maximum count number around k ¼ 100 nm À1 (typical N ave is 10) is on the order of 10 5 , which is not enough for EXAFS analysis. The VFC counter system is therefore not suitable for measurements with high time resolution (typically < 1 s).Electrical noise is a critical issue in determining the spectral quality and should be reduced as much as possible. The grounding wires of measurement systems should be connected to a single point ground in the stabilized power supply. The outputs from devices other than detectors should be electrically separated from the ADC using an isolation module. The signal cables between the detector and current amplifier should be low noise type and as short as possible. It is important to use a low-noise high-resolution type ADC and a low-noise fast-response type current amplifier.

Spatiotemporally Resolved QXAFS:
The spatiotemporally resolved QXAFS is a powerful tool for investigating the dynamic aspect of structures and electronic states of spatially heterogeneous samples during the chemical reaction. There are two types of two-dimensional (2D) spatiotemporally resolved QXAFS methods: microprobe QXAFS and a 2D full-field imaging QXAFS.The microprobe QXAFS method uses micro-and nano-beams. Reflective focusing optics such as the Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirror and capillary are commonly applied for QXAFS measurement since they have no chromatic aberration (see Sect. 10.1). The spatial resolution of the measurement is decided by the focused beam size, which can be less than 100 nm if using the KB mirror. In this method, the X-ray fluorescence mapping (XRF) is first measured to specify the distribution of the element and frame structure. Then, the QXAFS measurements are conducted on specific positions in the sample. The microprobe QXAFS method is difficult to apply for the point-by-point measurement of the transient reaction, and the quality of the XAFS spectra is significantly affected by the shift in the position irradiated by X-ray beams due to vibration and/or thermal drift in the focusing devices and sample stages during XAFS measurements. This is more serious when carrying out measurements with smaller X-ray beams. Therefore, the microprobe QXAFS measurements at fixed points require high stability on the devices concerning the focused beam position.Full-field QXAFS methods are generally more effective for site-dependent studies than point-by-point microprobe methods since the former can be conducted with almost no time lag when different sites are measured, which, however, can be used only for the transmission mode measurement. 2D full-field imaging QXAFS measurements are conducted using a 2D imaging detector such as PADs and indirect conversion method X-ray image detectorsThe minimum spatial resolution and field of view of the indirect conversion method X-ray image detectors is a few μm and several-hundred μm, and the monochromatized undulator beam flux is detectable without attenuation. This enables the measurement of one XAFS spectrum less than 1 s using this detector coupled with a high-speed CMOS sensor camera with a frame rate of more than 10 kHz and the focused beam from the tapered undulator. The actual time resolution, however, is limited by the spectral quality required for the analysis.The incident beam profile is usually approximated by the average of that measured before and after the QXAFS measurement at each energy point. Thus, this method requires high reproducibility on the incident beam profile by achieving high stabilities on the SR light source and X-ray optics, especially the monochromator.Most of 2D spatial-resolved QXAFS techniques have been applied for the static experiments. 2D spatiotemporally resolved QXAFS studies have just begun.

Combined Methods of QXAFS:
The simultaneous time-resolved method is a very useful and practical technique that enables probing the same part of the sample by complementary techniques and provides a detailed understanding of the dynamical chemical processes. This method gives more precise information than separately conducted measurements since the time-resolved experiments of the transient reactions might be generally difficult to reproduce exactly. So far, QXAFS has been combined with timeresolved SR X-ray-based methods such as X-ray diffractionIt is possible to conduct non-X-ray-based measurements at the same time as QXAFS measurements. However, there is a difference in probing depth between the X-ray and non-X-ray light.

Outlook:
In this section, QXAFS and related techniques were described from the point of view of instrumentation.The minimum time resolution of QXAFS is about one millisecond at present, which is limited by both monochromator scan speed and the response time of the ionization chamber. The performance of the present monochromator and ionization chamber seems to be close to the limit. To achieve higher time resolution, the development of a new technical principle for the monochromator and detector may be required. Also, a faster and more efficient fluorescence X-ray detector is expected to be developed for the measurement of dilute samples or thin films.Not so much research has been conducted using fast QXAFS measurements with the time resolution of less than a hundred milliseconds so far. The reason for this is not only the poor spectral quality stemming mainly from the X-ray flux but also the fact that it is not easy to construct the reaction cell included in the stimulation system for the actual samples with this time scale. It is expected that QXAFS investigation of fast chemical reactions will be driven by the development of a dedicated reaction cell.Time-resolved imaging techniques will be key for the investigation of the dynamic aspect of the actual heterogeneous chemical reaction. 2D spatiotemporally resolved QXAFS studies have just begun, and applications are expected to increase in various research fields. Recently, a 3D spatial-resolved XAFS method with a resolution of several tens of nm has been applied under ex situ conditions. 3D spatiotemporally resolved XAFS is expected to be realized as a result of such technology developments.The method combined with QXAFS is expected to further spread to SR X-raybased techniques such as X-ray computed tomography, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and X-ray emission spectroscopy.

Introduction:
This chapter presents an overview of energy dispersive X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EDXAS), as developed and used at synchrotron radiation sources. It mainly covers time resolved studies, with emphasis on technical aspects.In EDXAS, a curved crystal disperses and focuses a polychromatic X-ray beam onto the sample (Fig.Consequently, the energy of the X-ray beam diffracted by the crystal varies also continuously from one side of the crystal to the other, introducing a correlation between the X-ray beam propagation direction and its energy. The beam transmitted by the sample is then detected by a position sensitive detector, where the energy-direction correlation introduced by the polychromator is transformed into an energy-position correlation. To measure a XAS spectrum, the incident and transmitted intensities as a function of photon energy I 0 (E) and I 1 (E) are obtained from the spatial distribution of photons on the detector without and with the sample respectively. All energy points of the absorption spectrum are acquired in parallel. Due to the parallel acquisition scheme, an EDXAS spectrometer operates intrinsically in a time resolved manner. The time resolution is ultimately defined by the performance of the detector (minimum exposure time and maximum frame rate) and the characteristics of the X-ray source (number of photons per detector pixel).Besides the acquisition speed, another major advantage of EDXAS is its intrinsic stability, because during acquisition there are no moving components. This leads to a reduction of systematic noise and to high stability of the energy scale and focal S. Pascarelli (*) • O. Mathon European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, 38000 Grenoble, France e-mail: sakura@esrf.fr spot position. The combination of speed and stability has led to unprecedented sensitivity in the detection of atomic displacements through measurements in differential mode

Historical Development of EDXAS and Overview of Existing Facilities:
Synchrotrons all over the world have invested in EDXAS spectrometers in the past 40 years. Starting from the synchrotron pioneering work in the early 80s

Dispersive Versus Scanning Spectrometer for Time Resolved Experiments:
The main advantages of EDXAS spectrometers with respect to energy scanning spectrometers are: (1) the speed of acquisition, since all energy points are acquired in parallel on the position sensitive detector, (2) a small focal spot size together with a high flux, and (3) the stability of the energy scale and focal spot position, since there are no moving components during acquisition. There are two main limitations that are intrinsic to EDXAS. The first one is related to the need to maintain the energy-direction correlation created by the polychromator throughout the whole path from the crystal to the detector. This poses severe constraints on the morphology and microstructure of the sample: systems which produce strong small angle scattering are not suited for EDXAS (see for example Ref.In addition to these fundamental limitations, the EXAFS k-range is limited at low energies because the energy bandwidth of the polychromatic fan scales with the cotangent of the Bragg angle (see Eq. 8.1). Finally, the fact that in general the incident and transmitted intensity (I 0 and I 1 ) are not measured simultaneously may represent a drawback, especially in case of incident intensity fluctuations with time (X-ray beam instabilities). By giving up the parallel detection over the full energy range and using a sequential acquisition modeThe limitations mentioned above have certainly played a role in the development of EDXAS, and although this technique has spread quite rapidly, the EDXAS user community remains a minor portion of the global XAS user community. In addition to these intrinsic limitations, the technical challenges to build and use an EDXAS spectrometer are important: for example dealing with stability issues, designing efficient polychromator crystals and benders, or developing dedicated detectors.In the domain of dynamical studies, EDXAS beamlines have been historically used for applications dealing with homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysisDynamical processes on timescales faster than the 10 ms range can be investigated with scanning spectrometers by using pump and probe techniques, where the time evolution of the absorption at a single energy is recorded. But an EDXAS spectrometer can follow the process in "film" mode, i.e., with complete XAS spectra continuously recorded one after the other as the dynamical process evolves in time. If combined to a high flux source, an EDXAS spectrometer allows to obtain a sufficient signal to noise ratio in a single "film". This is particularly important for experiments that cannot be cycled indefinitely

The Energy Dispersive Spectrometer:
The energy dispersive spectrometer employs a curved crystal to focus and disperse a polychromatic fan of X-rays onto the sample position, introducing a correlation between the photon energy and the direction of propagation (see Fig.This Section introduces the basic equations for the evaluation of energy bandpass and energy resolution and discusses the limitations on the focal spot of an EDXAS spectrometer. Beamline ID24 at the ESRF is used as an illustrative example.

Energy Bandwidth:
The full spectral range diffracted by the crystal ΔE is proportional to the variation of Bragg angle θ along the beam footprint on the crystal, Δθ: where E 0 is the central energy. Δθ can be calculated from p, q, and L as follows:2) is valid as long as L/sinθ is smaller than the useful length of the polychromator crystal. In general, EDXAS spectrometers are installed on synchrotron sources having a large horizontal divergence, which easily provides a large beam footprint on the surface of the crystal to provide a sufficiently large energy bandwidth ΔE to cover a full EXAFS spectrum in a single shot. Equation (8.1) highlights an additional important limitation of EDXAS: at low energies, the full spectral range diffracted by the polychromator ΔE is strongly reduced due to the cotθ factor. This is illustrated in Fig.

Energy Resolution:
The energy resolution of an energy dispersive spectrometer depends on the central energy, E 0 , the crystal diffracting planes (h, k, l), the focusing distance q and detector position d. A simple expression δE/E for can be derived from Bragg's law:¼ δθ cot θ 0 ; ð8:3Þ where δθ is the overall "monochromatic" angular spread. For a polychromator in Bragg geometry (i.e., the incident and the diffracted beam propagate on the same side of the crystal), δθ includes contributions from several factors: the spatial resolution of the detector δθ 1 , the size of the X-ray source δθ 2 , and the Darwin width of the curved polychromator crystal δθ 3 :ð8:4ÞThe Darwin width spread due to the crystal curvature is included in δθ 3 .The incident beam intercepts Bragg planes with a continuously different angle when it penetrates the crystal leading to an asymmetrical reflectivity profile of the highly curved Bragg-type crystalThese figures show that the main contributions derive from δθ 3 . In particular, Fig.

Focusing Properties:
Focusing using bent Bragg planes cannot be described in the same way as focusing with total reflection optical elements. Due to X-ray beam penetration into the crystal, there are two effects that affect focusing. The first one is due to the variation of Bragg angle as a function of penetration depth, due to the bent shape of the crystal (see Fig.if the diffraction profile is approximated by a rectangle. At 7 keV for a Si(1 1 1) crystal the intrinsic dynamical contribution to the focal spot size is Δx ~2 μm. This result has been confirmed by dynamical theory simulations of the Bragg bender caseFor a polychromatic incident beam, the final spot size is the result of the sum of all monochromatic contributions. Therefore focusing a polychromatic incident divergent beam with a bent crystal leads to an intrinsic spot size limit of the order of 2 μm FWHM in the Bragg geometry. Another limiting factor to the spot size is the slope error of the Bragg polychromator crystal. The difficulties here are related to the manufacture of large Si crystals, the thickness of which needs to remain constant to within a few microns along the full length. The protocol for the manufacture of such crystals is constantly being improved, but it is still very difficult to achieve the desired shape over the full footprint of the beam on the polychromator. The consequences are that focal spot sizes will in general be dependent on the portion of the polychromatic fan (or on the portion of the illuminated footprint on the crystal) that is selected. On ID24, at the Fe K-edge and at q ~0.75 m, the focal spot achieved is ~4 Â 4 μm 2 FWHM with an selected energy range of ΔE sel ~500 eV, although the full spectral range diffracted by the polychromator in this geometry is ΔE ~800 eV (from Eq. 8.1). The accuracy of the crystal bending and therefore the bender and crystal preparation technology is a key point of the EDXAS spectrometer.The first papers reporting on XAS studies of kinetics down to the ms timescale appeared at the XAFS conference in 1986

Down to the μs:
Below the ms, fluorescent screen based CCD cameras start to be limited either by the maximum repetition rate of the detector or/and the decay time of the scintillator screen. To overcome these limitations, microstrip-based detector have been specifically developed for EDXAS ultra-fast X-ray spectroscopy studies. A first version based on a 1024 element Si microstrip chip combined with custom developed low noise, fast readout, electronics (XCHIP)When integration time decreases down to few tens of microseconds, the natural X-ray time structure of synchrotron based sources cannot be neglected and a synchronization of the detection to the electron bunch (in general with the RF cavity) is mandatory. FigureIn this range of timescales, between the ms and the μs, a dispersive spectrometer can be particularly suited to study matter under extreme conditions of pressure, temperature, and magnetic field. The interest is not directly linked to the dynamics 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0  of the experiment but rather to the capacity to create thermodynamical states that are metastable, difficult or very expensive to produce for longer periods or completely unreachable in static mode.The dispersive spectrometer is of particular interest when the experiment is non-reversible, for example when the sample in destroyed at the end of the run (single shot experiment). This is especially true when the dispersive spectrometer is coupled with a high flux source like an undulator or a wiggler. The flux on the sample can then reach 10 14 photons per seconds in the energy bandwidth, leading to a flux of about 10 5 photons per pixel (per XAS point) and per μs. In theory, this flux is sufficient to obtain a good signal to noise ratio in the XAS spectrum in a single shot experiment. This possibility is illustrated by recent work on dynamic excitation of Fe towards the warm dense matter regime using ohmic rampsFigureFig.

Below the Microseconds:
Below the μs it becomes necessary to work with a single X-ray bunch. The technique generally used is the pump-and-probe approach where the time resolution is defined by the delay between the pump (start) and the probe (stop). The time resolution is then limited either by the duration of the pump or by the duration of the probe. In practice, the time resolution is very often limited by the duration of the X-ray bunch, i.e., around 100 ps. The role of the detector in this mode is only to select the desired X-ray bunch and to reject the side bunches. The important parameter of the detector is consequently the minimum integration time. The XH, with a minimum integration time of about 80 ns, is perfectly suited for this kind of experiments. From a general point of view, the repetition rate of the experiment is limited by the repetition rate of the pump, for example, a laser operating at few tens of Hertz. Consequently, the request for the repetition rate of the detector is less demanding than in "film" mode. The principal disadvantage of the dispersive approach with respect to similar pump-probe applications using scanning spectrometers, is the restriction to a transmission geometry. However, this limitation is alleviated with highly stable X-ray sources, and thus the intrinsic gain by multiplexing the X-ray spectrum is still a very significant real-time gain in kinetic studies of structural changes. EDXAS in combination with a single 100 ps bunch has been used to take fast snapshots of the time evolution of photo-excited Cu based complexesThe additional value of using a dispersive spectrometer in such pump-and-probe method is highlighted again when the experiment is non-repeatable. For example, when the pump itself is not perfectly reproducible (i.e., the energy delivered by the laser is not constant shot to shot) or when the sample is damaged or destroyed at the end of each pump-and-probe cycle. It is then important to obtain a sufficiently good signal-to-noise ratio with a single X-ray bunch integration. At ESRF with the ID24 EDXAS spectrometer, in four bunch filling mode and coupled to four undulators, 20,000 ph./pixels/single X-ray bunch have been measured at 7 keV in the direct beam. This is sufficient to obtain clean XANES features in many cases. A recent experiment has shown that EXAFS measurements can be achieved on dynamically compressed Fe by means of a high power laser pulse (Fig.

Introduction:
Changes of structure and chemical states of catalysts have been successfully observed with XAFS under reaction conditions. Nowadays, a XAFS spectrum can be obtained even within several milliseconds by using quick XAFS (QXAFS) and dispersive XAFS (DXAFS) techniques. However, much faster fundamental processes of catalysts should be also key phenomena to understanding catalytic reactions. For example, lifetimes of photocarriers, transfer processes and active sites of catalysis should govern the photocatalytic activity. In order to observe such fast events, the demanding time resolution of XAFS measurements is less than microseconds, which is much shorter than the time resolution of QXAFS and DXAFS techniques. A pump-probe XAFS technique is applicable if the processes can take place repeatedly. The pump-probe XAFS technique has been developed since 1980s

A Typical Pump-Probe XAFS System:
X-rays coming from synchrotrons are short pulses with 100-ps time duration (or less than 100 ps). A pulse laser is employed to excite electronic states of samples and is synchronized with the X-ray pulses so that XAFS spectra of the excited states can be recorded with a 100-ps time resolution. As an example of the pump-probe XAFS system, a schematic setup at the beamline NW14A, Photon Factory Advanced Ring (PF-AR), Tsukuba, Japan is shown in Fig.Pump-probe XAFS systems in other synchrotron radiation facilities are similar as far as the laser frequency is much less than that of X-ray pulses. It is noted that the synchronization between X-ray pulses and the excitation laser should be taken into account on the measurements of incident X-ray intensity (I 0 ). Most of synchrotron radiation facilities are operated in a multi-bunch mode and each electron bunch gives a different X-ray intensity. The intensity of I 0 synchronized with the laser has to be also measured selectively in order to normalize X-ray absorption correctly. In such a case, fast detectors (PMT or an avalanche photodiode) and an electric gating system (boxcar integrator) should be employed for I 0 measurements. In contrast, slow detectors such as ionization chambers are available to measure I 0 in the facilities operated in the single-bunch mode as PF-AR.The pump-probe XAFS technique is a very useful and powerful technique to understand the structure and the chemical state of excited species. However, it was difficult to obtain the data with a good S/N ratio enough to analyze EXAFS. Normally the excitation lasers for the pump-probe XAFS experiments were operated at about 1 kHz in order to make the laser fluence as large as possible. The photon flux of X-rays was poor at such a low repetition rate (the repetition rate from synchrotrons is usually 1 MHz or much more). It took much longer time to obtain reliable data than normal XAFS measurements. Recently, new pump-probe XAFS systems have been established at Advanced Light Source (APS), Chicago, USA

Applications of the Pump-Probe XAFS Technique:
There have been studies on photoexcited species in solvents observed by the pumpprobe XAFS technique and the recent results of the pump-probe XAFS experiments were reviewedRecently, Uemura et al. reported the photoexcitation states of WO 3 observed by the pump-probe XAFS techniqueIn Fig.

X-Ray Free Electron Laser:
The time resolution of the pump-probe XAFS technique is typically 100 ps which is the pulse duration of the X-ray pulses from storage rings. Today, much shorter X-ray pulses can be obtained in X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFEL). XFEL provides intense and coherent X-ray pulses whose duration is less than 50 fs. The intense and short X-ray pulses can give opportunities to access the dynamics of structure and electronic states of photoexcited species in a femtosecond timescale. The photoexcited state of Fe[bpy] 2+ was reported in the XFEL in USA (LCLS)Recently, the focusing techniques of X-ray beams are developing and micron to nanometer size X-ray beams can be prepared at synchrotron facilities. Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors are practical optics to focus down X-ray beams, and the utilization of such focusing X-ray beams enables to visualize the heterogeneous properties of solid materials. Micro-XAFS and nano-XAFS have been developed as simple two-dimensional spatially resolved XAFS techniques and applied for solid samples such as heterogeneous catalysts.

Principle of Micro/Nano-XAFS:
The optical setup of micro-XAFS or nano-XAFS is simple as illustrated in Fig.Focusing size of X-ray beams depends on the accuracy of KB mirrors and beam line at a synchrotron facility. Recently, hard X-ray beams for XAFS measurements can be focused down to micron to nanometer size, and XAFS measurements using focused X-ray beams are called as micro-XAFS or nano-XAFS, depending on X-ray beam size. The space resolution of the XAFS measurements is decided by both X-ray beam size and the scanning distance of a piezo stage that a sample is mounted. 100 nm-order X-ray beams are processed in the hard X-ray region for nano-XAFS analysis at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan)Fluorescent X-rays from a sample irradiated focused X-rays are often so small that sufficient acquisition time is required for micro/nano-XAFS measurements. In particular, EXAFS data requires long acquisition time. The drifts of optics and a sample stage are serious to damage to the space resolution of nano-XAFS measurements with long acquisition time. The drift of temperature is often seriously affected to the drifts of the equipment, and a set of KB mirrors is used to be set in a closed chamber filled with inert helium gas (Fig.Micro/nano-XAFS displays great ability to monitor the chemical information of heterogeneous solid materials at micro/nanometer scale. In the case of a powder sample, which is one of the typical forms of solid materials, the micro/nano-XAFS can separate structural information at particle level (Fig.

Applications of Micro-XAFS to Environmental Analysis:
Microanalysis using X-ray beam started from environmental analysis application, which is one of the active fields for microanalysis. Various environmental matrices such as rocks, peats, soils, minerals, and sediments have been analyzed by micro-XAFS combining micro-XRFIndustrial waste, ash, and dust were also analyzed by micro-XRF and micro-XAFS techniques and the distribution of several elements in the samples were elucidated

Applications of Micro/Nano-XAFS to Solid Catalysts:
XAFS becomes one of the most typical characterization techniques of solid catalysts, in particular supported metal species on support surfaces because of its non-crystalline structures at the surfaces. Because of their limited loading on support surfaces, the utilization of synchrotron facility is necessary to record high quality data for EXAFS analysis. Micro/nano-XANES/EXAFS are applied to heterogeneous solid catalysts, showing the distribution of composing elements and their local structures. Ce-Zr mixed oxides have been used as supports of automobile exhausting catalysts because of their oxygen storage/release propertiesThe catalyst pretreatments (reduction and oxidation) bring about both changes in the attached Ni and the oxygen content ( y) of the CZ-y support. The systematic characterization of the NiO x /CZ-y catalyst by XRD, Ni K-edge XANES and EXAFS, and Ce L III -edge XANES and EXAFS, suggested that metallic Ni was active species for the reforming reaction. It was found that the reforming activity was decided by not only the chemical state of Ni but also the oxygen content ( y) in the CZ-y support. The reduction of NiO x species at the surfaces strongly depended on the nature of the CZ-y support, and the transport of oxygen atoms at the interface of NiO x and the CZ-y surface is suggested to be key issue to decide the reforming activity.The average size of the CZ-y was 750 AE 370 nm, and a focused hard X-ray beam with a similar size (1000 nm (h) Â 800 nm (v)) can be prepared at Ni K-edge (8332 eV) at the SPring-8 BL37XU station. The catalyst particles were dispersed on a thin SiO 2 membrane with the thickness of 30 μm and oxidized and reduced samples (NiO/CZ-8 and Ni/CZ-7, respectively) were independently prepared by the appropriate oxidation/reduction processes at 773 K. The fraction of aggregated particles on the SiO 2 membranes was estimated to be 0.7 % and 1.9 % for the NiO/ CZ-8 and Ni/CZ-7 samples, respectively, by the analysis of SEM images, indicating the most of the catalyst particles were isolated on the substrates.The X-ray beam focused by KB mirrors, whose energy was 8428 eV, was irradiated to the sample, and micro-XRF was recorded by two-dimensionally scanning of a sample stage mounting the sample (Fig.Then the micro-XANES and EXAFS spectra were measured at the center of the catalyst particle determined by the mapping of micro-XRF. FigureWe also measured the micro-EXAFS spectrum of the NiO/CZ-8 particle, which was inactive phase for the methane reforming reaction. The Ni K-edge micro-EXAFS spectrum recorded for 3 h could be successfully curve-fitted as shown in Fig.On the NiO x /CZ-y catalyst, small Ni particles attached on the surface of the CZ support, and the distribution and local coordination of each Ni particles cannot be visualized by micro-XAFS technique because of its spatial resolution much larger than the particle size. The reduction of focusing size of X-ray beams and mechanical drift during measurements should be improved to achieve higher spatial resolution for the micro-analysis. It is significant that the obtained image is two-dimensional reflection of a sample and the resolution of depth direction is lost in the mapping

Analysis of a Single Catalyst Particle by Nano-XAFS:
Recently, focused X-ray nanobeam, whose size was 320 nm (h) Â 250 nm (v) or 190 nm (h) Â 290 nm (v), at Ce L III -edge (5.7 keV) was processed at the BL39XU or BL36XU station at SPring-8 (Fig.Several Pt/CZ-y samples with different oxygen compositions ( y) ranging between 7 and 8 were prepared on thin SiC membranes (300 nm thick). The appropriate treatments with hydrogen or oxygen brought about changing in their oxygen compositions, which were estimated by powder X-ray diffraction. Accompanied with decreasing oxygen compositions in the CZ-y support by the reduction with H 2 , the down shifts of their diffraction peaks (e.g., (4 4 0) diffraction) were clearly observed, as reflected the expansion of its lattice parameters (Fig.In contrast, nano-XAFS provided the structural information of each particle, as shown in Fig.We compared several particles with different oxygen compositions in Fig.The present scanning nano-XAFS analysis cannot reveal metal species supported on the surface of CZ support because of its limited spatial resolution. Local structure at the interface of supported metal species and the CZ support would be related to the bulk oxygen diffusion and reactivity of the supported catalysts. The further developments on the spatial resolution of nano-XAFS and the utilization of model catalyst systems would be promising to approach the domain structures of such heterogeneous materials.

Micro/Nano-XAFS Applications to Electrocatalysts and Fuel Cell Catalysts:
The synthesis and utilization of electrocatalysts are one of the most important targets for micro/nano-XAFS analysis. In particular, the visualization of membrane electrode assembly (MEA), which is a thin membrane material coated with electrocatalyst layers for polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC), is applied for space-resolved analysisFigureTakao et al. also reported non-destructive same-view nano (228 nm Â 225 nm)-XAFS and TEM/STEM-EDS imagings for the PEFC MEA Pt/C cathode catalyst layers under humid N 2 atmosphere by using a new same-view stacking membrane cell

Perspective:
The spatially resolved micro-XAFS and nano-XAFS techniques using X-ray focused beams can provide new insights into the two-dimensional spatial visualization and mapping of the morphology, composition, domain structure, coordination structure, oxidation states, corrosion, aggregation, fragmentation, etc. which are critical issues for property, functionality, and catalysis of micromaterials and nanomaterials such as catalysts, functional materials, fuel cells, batteries, devices, biomaterials, and marine resources. These in situ and ex situ XAFS techniques can also image depth profiles of thin membranes like PEFC MEAs. The techniques can be consorted with other techniques such as TEM/STEM-EDS and ambient-pressure HAXPES, which may address complementary analysis results from combined viewpoints. The element-selective nano-XAFS is a promising technique to visualize the inhomogeneous presence and distribution of chemical states in a single micro/nanoparticle as well as a variety of nanomaterials.

Chapter 11:
Computed Laminography XAFS Mizuki Tada and Hirosuke Matsui Three-dimensional imaging of a solid sample is attractive for high-throughput and non-destructive characterization methods, and computed tomography (CT) is well developed and widely used for several analytical methods such as electron microscopy. X-ray computed tomography (XCT) can obtain three-dimensional structural data of a solid sample, in particular morphology and elemental information.At the measurements of XCT, a sample is perpendicularly rotated to an incident X-rays, and transmission image at each rotating angle is recorded with a two-dimensional detector. A series of transmission images at different rotation angles are computationally reconstructed and a three-dimensional image of the sample is obtainedThe conventional reconstruction of XCT requires XCT projected images at all rotating angles to obtain absolute three-dimensional image of a sample (Fig.In XCL, the rotating axis of a sample is not fixed at 90 to incident X-ray beam as shown in Fig.A reconstructed XCT or XCL image at an X-ray energy corresponds to be X-ray absorbance mapping at the energy, as a result, the three-dimensional structural image (morphology) of a sample is visualized. When the X-ray energy of XCT or XCL measurements is changed, a three-dimensional X-ray absorbance mapping at the different X-ray energy is obtained. From XCT or XCL images at particular X-ray energies, spectroscopic information at each position of a sample can be discussed. The method combining XCT/XCL and XAFS spectroscopy is called XCT-XAFS/XCL-XAFSWe applied the XCL-XAFS technique to a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC), which is a flat membrane sample with layered structures. In a PEFC MEA, there are two catalyst layers at cathode and anode, and they are stacked on the surface of a Nafion membrane. The dissolution and degradation of Pt cathode electrocatalysts are still serious problems for practical operation of PEFC, and the XCL-XAFS showed the heterogeneous distribution of Pt cathode electrocatalysts in the MEA in a non-destructive mannerMEAs commercially prepared (5 Â 5 cm 2 ) with 50 wt% Pt/C cathode electrocatalysts were conducted to typical voltage-cycling steps. A degraded MEA was prepared by the additional aging and accelerated degradation testing (200 cycles). Both samples were cut into 1 cm Â 1 cm pieces and set on SiC membrane holders. The thickness of the cathode catalyst layer of the fresh MEA was observed to be about 140-210 μm by cross-sectional SEM analysis (Fig.

2).:
Ex situ XCL-XAFS of the PEFC MEAs was measured at the BL47XU beamline at SPring-8, Japan. X-rays from the BL47XU undulator were monochromatized by Si(1 1 1) crystals. A rotating beam diffuser composed of a sheet of a paper was installed at the upstream part of the experimental hutch to reduce speckle noisesXCL images at 11.496 keV, which is the energy before Pt L III -edge, showed the morphology of the MEA samples as shown in Fig.We recorded XCL images at a different X-ray energy of 11.572 keV after Pt L III edge, which corresponds to be the isosbestic point of Pt and PtO 2 . Difference in X-ray absorption intensity at 11.572 keV to that at 11.496 keV can be calculated by the XCL images at these energies, showing the spatio-distribution of Pt species in the samples.An in situ PEFC cell was developed for in situ XCL-XAFS measurements as presented in Fig.At the depth of a gas diffusion layer at cathode, the morphology of carbon fiber was clearly visualized in the cross-sectional XCL image (Fig.In the cases of Pt cathode electrocatalysts in PEFC, the structural differences in the Pt electrocatalysts are not so large and the surfaces of Pt nanoparticles oxidized or reduced in the operating cycles. Expected differences in the Pt L III -edge XANES and EXAFS spectra are so small to clearly detect by in situ XCL-XAFS and it was difficult to obtain significant imaging data of Pt L III -edge XCL-XAFS for the sample under in situ conditions with lots of water. The application of limitedangle XCT-XAFS would be promising to approach in situ three-dimensional imaging of PEFC MEAs.

X-Ray Absorption with Transmission X-Ray Microscopes:
Frank de Groot

Introduction:
In this section we focus on the use of transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM) to measure the XAS spectra. In the last decade a range of soft X-ray and hard X-ray TXM microscopes have been developed, allowing the measurement of XAS spectra with 10-100 nm resolution. In the hard X-ray range the TXM experiments pose the same restrictions on in situ experiments as bulk XAS experiments, allowing experiments with capillaries to study catalysts under working conditions. In the soft X-ray range, dedicated transmission nanoreactors are needed. Considering catalysts the main result the in situ TXM experiments are the determination of nanometer range variations of catalysts under working conditions. An important property of X-rays is their short wavelength below 1 nm. This allows direct imaging of catalysts in scanning mode or full field mode. In contrast, visible light with an energy of 1 eV has a diffraction limited resolution of approximately 500 nm and VUV light with an energy of 10 eV has a diffraction limit of ~50 nm. We will compare TXM microscopes in detail with transmission electron microscopes (TEM) that allow a similar combination with spectroscopy using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). We will omit scanning probe near field microscopes as they are limited to surfaces and do not directly look at the interior of catalyst materials, including the non-exposed internal surfaces. Catalytic activity very often takes place within micro and/or mesoporous structures implying that not only the external surface of a catalyst is of importance. Examples include the active sites within zeolites and enzymes. The catalytic active sites in these systems cannot be studied with probes that only map the outside of the system. TEM and TXM F. de Groot (*) Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis, Utrecht University, 3584 CG Utrecht, The Netherlands e-mail: f.m.f.degroot@uu.nl detect a column of material through the system of study. As such they provide information on both the surface structure and the internal structure of a material.

Soft X-Ray TXM Microscopes:
In a scanning TXM microscope, a synchrotron X-ray absorption beamline is used to illuminate a Fresnel zone plate. The zone plate characteristics determine the spot size to which the X-ray beam is focused, typically between 10 and 50 nm. The focal length is in the order of a few millimeters, which is a design limitation for in situ reactor cells. Full-field TXMs use two zone plates, allowing the synchronous detection of an image planeSoft X-ray K edges can be interpreted as mapping the empty states of the element under study. The variation in the empty states implies variation in the XAS spectral shape, which can be used for chemical contrast. The spectral shapes of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen containing systems reveal a large variation in spectral shapes and, as such, are ideal for chemical contrastSoft X-rays have a strong interaction with matter. This implies that transmission experiments are only possible for solid samples of limited thickness. In addition, the transmission through gas atmospheres is also affected by significant soft X-ray absorption, limiting the X-ray path through the gas phase to several 100 μm. The windows should ideally have thickness below 50 nm of a light material. The sample thickness for soft X-rays must ideally be in the (sub)micron range, dependent also on concentration and elemental composition. Note that the experiments are transmission experiments implying that the edge energy and concentration of the probed element determines the ideal thickness of the sample.Because of the X-ray transmission induced sample limitations, traditionally soft XAS spectra have been measured with electron yield detection or fluorescence yield (FY) detection. Yield methods use the core hole decay, which gives rise to electrons and X-rays escaping from the surface of the substrate. Detection of these decay products, allows the measurement of samples with arbitrary thickness. With total electron yield (TEY), one detects all electrons that emerge from the sample surface and due to the electron escape depth of a few nm this turns the TXM into a surface technique. For dilute systems, transmission might not yield a measurable signal and FY is an option. A complication is that the optical component of a TXM microscope is usually very close to the sample, which makes it difficult to use TEY and FY detectors. Soft X-ray TXM is ideally suited to study, in addition to the organic phase (by their C, N, O K edges) also the inorganic phase via their metal edges.In Fig.

Nanoreactors:
One common goal in the design of nanoreactors is the minimization of the path length that X-rays have to travel through the gas and/or liquid reactant phase. This will minimize X-ray attenuation and yield higher signal intensities. One possibility is to use nanoreactors that are designed for in situ TEM studies

Comparison of STXM-XAS with STEM-EELS:
The main difference between STXM-XAS and STEM-EELS is the significantly stronger interaction with matter of electrons compared with X-rays

Detection Modes and Limits:
In STEM-EELS all core levels are measured simultaneously. In STXM-XAS, the X-ray energy is set to one particular value and only at that energy the X-ray absorption is measured. STXM-XAS can be measured with EY and turned into a surface probe, or it can be measured with FY for dilute species. STEM-EELS and STXM-XAS are transmission experiments and the required contrast for a core level signal implies that spectral shapes of dilute species cannot be measured. As a rule, concentrations above 5000 ppm are required for good spectra.

In Situ Conditions and Sample Thickness:
Soft X-ray STXM can be measured up to 2 bar and up to 550 C. Hard X-ray experiments can be performed under extreme conditions, including high-pressure diamond anvil cells. STEM-EELS requires a sample less than ~200 nm thin. STXM-XAS can handle samples with thicknesses up to 20 μm at 1.5 keV and in the millimeter range for hard X-rays. The much thicker specimen that can be handled with STXM-XAS offers a wider and more flexible range of materials that can be studied, including objects such as intact biological cells.

Sample Damage:
STEM-EELS requires a high radiation dose in comparison with normal TEM, which implies that sample damage is potentially high, including knock-on damage, carbon deposition, sputtering, and electrostatic charging. In STXM-XAS a highly focused X-ray beam is used, which, especially at resonance, generates large amount of electrons, yielding damage from electrostatic charging and carbon deposition. Combining all beam damage effects and the required doses for imaging, as a rule it is found that STXM-XAS causes less damage than STEM-EELSIn conclusion, it can be stated that STEM-EELS offers better spatial resolution and the simultaneous detection of all core levels. STXM-XAS can handle large samples and a wider range of sample conditions including catalysis under working conditions.

Future Developments:
The temperature and pressure range of STXM will increase to 1000 C and 10 bar, thereby extending the range of feasible materials science and catalysis experiments. An important future development is the performance of in situ STXM tomographic experiments. STXM of ultra-dilute samples with concentrations down to 100 ppm are not straightforward in transmission mode, implying that fluorescence yield detection must be used. Such fluorescence yield based experiments would allow the mapping of impurities/promoters in heterogeneous catalyst and in materials science in general.STXM will likely not reach the 0.1 nm spatial resolution as obtained by electron microscopy. STEM-EELS experiments on the other hand will be unfeasible for many samples and for many sample conditions.

Operando EXAFS and XANES of Catalytic Solids and Related Materials Gareth T. Whiting, Florian Meirer, and Bert M.

Introduction:
The continuous improvement of X-ray sources, optics, and detectors since the start of the twenty first century has paved the way for unprecedented studies of functional materials at work. Studying these typically highly complex materials while they are working requires a sophisticated combination of analysis techniques that can provide chemical information about the ongoing processes at multiple timeand/or length scales. This makes X-rays an excellent probe for such studies, as they are (usually) non-destructive, can be used for relatively fast processes (0.01-2 s), and can operate in harsh environments, for example under high pressure or temperature. In order to link the (spatio-)temporal chemical information obtained by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to the task performed by the functional material, it is necessary to collect additional complementary information about the running process (performance). It is this simultaneous measurement together with a combined data analysis that defines "operando" studies.We therefore want to start by defining the term "operando," in the context of XAS and how it differs from the term "in situ." Taking the topic of catalysis as an example, "operando" (latin for working/operating) XAS analysis (oxidation state, local coordination, etc.) involves studying the catalyst in its working place, under true reaction conditions. Whereas "in situ" (latin for on site), has been reported for both true and model catalytic reaction conditions. Moreover, in order for a system to be termed "operando," the simultaneous online analysis of activity and/or selectivity (performance) with for example, mass spectrometry (MS) or gas chromatography (GC), must take placeAlthough this description of operando XAS may appear simplistic, the combination of both structural/chemical characterization (XANES/EXAFS) and performance analysis under true reaction conditions poses a considerable challenge. Depending on the heterogeneous catalytic process (solid/liquid or solid/gas interface), true reaction conditions often refer to "harsh" conditions, such as high pressures, high temperatures and in some cases potentially harmful reactants/ products (among others), which requires the use of specially designed reactors/ cells. Moreover, correlating XAS data with performance data in a spatially and temporally resolved manner is considerably difficult, given the bulk nature of "standard" XANES/EXAFS analysis and the fast kinetics of most catalytic reactions, respectively. Therefore, advanced XAS techniques are required (i.e., Quick-XAS, transmission X-ray microscopy), which make it possible to measure spectra on the sub-second time-scale and in a spatially resolved manner.The origin of the term "operando" in relation to spectroscopy was first proposed during a discussion between Eric Gaigneaux, Gerhard Mestl, Miguel Bañares, and Bert Weckhuysen in 2000 during the 220th ACS National Meeting in Washington, DC (USA)When looking to the operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) literature (Fig.

Case Study 1: Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis:
The Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) process, invented by Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch in 1926, involves the conversion of synthesis gas (mixture of H 2 and CO), into long-chain hydrocarbonsAs discussed previously, cell design is of vital importance in determining the possibility of performing time-resolved experiments with conditions that mimic "real/working" catalytic reaction conditions. Rochet et al.Unlike standard extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements which can take up to 20 min-1 h to acquire an X-ray absorption spectrum, Quick-EXAFS (QEXAFS) measurements allow the acquisition of the EXAFS in just a few seconds using a continuous-scan mode of the monochromator and maintains a high signal-to-noise ratio. QEXAFS experiments were performed in transmission mode at the SAMBA beamline at SOLEIL (Source Optimise ´e de Lumie `re d'Energie Interme ´diaire de LURE), France, with the outlet of the reactor cell connected to an AirHead™ probe for online Raman spectroscopy monitoring of hydrocarbons produced. The conversion rate of CO was determined using a known CO partial pressure at the inlet and measuring it again at the outlet of the cell. Also, by applying a multivariate analysis approach to the C-H vibration bands that formed, information regarding product (alkane) selectivity was obtained, in order to relate performance with structural alterations on the catalyst (QEXAFS). During the activation treatment (under reducing atmosphere), the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) of the recorded spectra revealed that the Co 3 O 4 spinel structure in CoO was reduced as expected, to metallic cobalt. However, 23 % of the catalyst was still present as CoO, showing an insufficient reduction. When switching to a syngas atmosphere (270 C, H 2 /CO ratio of 2 at 20 bar), 76 % CO conversion was achieved and a significant intensity of Raman bands attributed to alkanes (69 % methane) and water were produced, with a slight reoxidation of the Co metallic nanoparticles. This was observed to be nanoparticle size-dependent using EXAFS analysis, with 2-4 nm nanoparticles being thermodynamically susceptible to oxidation. As methane selectivity and water production is drastically reduced upon decreasing the reaction temperature to 230 C (accompanied by an increase in selectivity towards higher alkanes), the cobalt species are further reduced. This is associated with the increasing partial pressure of water, with a metal core-thin oxide layer-like structure thought to form. However, it is inherently difficult to interpret such structures from a mixture of "totally reduced Co nanoparticles... mixed with irreducible small CoO nanoparticles"Rochet et al.Coupling a mass spectrometer to the outlet of the in situ cell provides another means of measuring catalytic performance simultaneously during XAS analysis. Tsakoumis et al.Cats et al. have applied a means to overcome this limitation, using Transmission X-ray Microscopy (TXM), to gain spatial resolution (better than 30 nm in 2D) on a single working 15 wt% Co/TiO 2 FTS catalyst particleAs stated previously, Fe-based catalysts are also important in the FTS process and are on par with Co-based catalysts in terms of the number of operando XAS investigations. One of the more standout case studies is on the stability and reactivity of ε, χ, and θ iron-carbide phases during realistic FTS conditions (10 bar, 250 C, CO/H 2 : 5:5 mL/min) by de Smit et al.The lack of spatial resolution in the field of operando XAS is one current limitation that needs to be addressed in the future. Previous to the work of Cats et al.conditions and compared with TXM data. It was shown that with increasing time on stream, FeC x crystallites enlarge or increase in number, which is linked with an increasing selectivity to methane (and decrease in selectivity to CO).It is clear that these few operando studies are paving the way to a better understanding of the structure-performance relationships in FTS processes. The combination of XAS analysis with online catalytic performance allows for a better understanding of the mechanistic aspects during the reaction, which cannot be realized with model systems or under idealistic conditions (in situ/ex situ). Usually these methods provide information on catalysts that are exposed to environments other than the true working conditions, or on catalysts, which contain an unrealistic loading of active metal. Given the numerous deactivation mechanisms proposed from such studies, these recent operando studies help resolve these postulations.We have now obtained a relation of Co oxidation/reduction with water partial pressure produced in the reactor, together with monitoring of the Co local structure during all stages of the FTS process. Although vast improvements have been made on these initial operando studies, more focus is needed on the enhancement of spatial resolution (i.e., TXM), as XAS is a bulk technique and catalyst surface-gas phase information is needed to further the development of the catalytic FTS process.

Case Study 2: Benzyl Alcohol Oxidation:
The partial oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones plays a major role in the fine chemicals industry. An example of which is the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, used in processes such as the production of perfumes and pharmaceuticals, to name but a few. Benzaldehyde is commonly produced using environmentally undesirable solvents, such as chlorinated hydrocarbonsOne of the earliest examples of operando XAS analysis on supported catalysts dates back as early as 2003, with Grunwaldt et al. using a 0.5 wt% Pd/Al 2 O 3 supported catalyst and "supercritical" CO 2 (scCO 2 ) as the solvent for benzyl alcohol oxidationThe more common approach to aerobic benzyl alcohol oxidation involves a liquid phase catalytic reaction. Mondelli et al. studied a 0.75 wt% Bi promoted 5 wt % Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst during the reactionThese studies show that operando XAS can be used even under the harshest of reaction conditions in "supercritical" and liquid-phase processes. One of the main reasons that operando conditions can be applied for this process is the cell design, which unlike previous in situ experiments, allows the capture of surface species formed (using spectroscopic techniques) leading to catalytic performance evaluation, with simultaneous structural/oxidation state analysis. As stated previously, these structure-performance relationships are vital, with an understanding of the role of the promoter in the complex reaction mechanisms potentially leading to better process efficiency, due to enhanced catalyst development. Previously obtained knowledge on the liquid-phase oxidation of alcohols mainly focused on the use of spectro-electrochemical methods, with model catalysts and electrolytic solutions

Case Study 3: Propane Dehydrogenation:
The significant interest in the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes, in particular propane, is due to the high demand for propene (also commonly referred to as propylene), as an important intermediate for a range of chemical applications, i.e., polypropylene productionIn order to develop an understanding of the catalyst behavior during dehydrogenation and regeneration during typical propane dehydrogenation conditions, Beale et al. proposed a unique combination of ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis)/ Raman/XAS in one setupIn comparison with Mo/Al 2 O 3 , the initial coke formation occurred at a higher rate than in Mo/SiO 2 . Finally, the dispersed MoO 3 species present on the surface Mo/Al 2 O 3 were found to be harder to reduce than the MoO 3 clusters on Mo/SiO 2 . Almost 5 years later, Iglesias-Juez et al. used a combination of UV-Vis/Raman together with operando high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) XANES measurements, in order to observe the effect multiple reactionregeneration cycles have on catalytic behaviorGiven the nature of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, whereby varying cycles are required to remove coke and reactivate the catalyst, an operando study is vital to securing information on the behavior of the catalyst under true conditions, which can aid in process efficiency, i.e., by adjusting the length time of each cycle. Concerning the case studies discussed here, we now have an understanding of how coking is linked with the promoting metal and active metal oxidation state (i.e., Mo) and subsequently the catalytic activity. Furthermore, by maintaining the operando method upon regeneration cycles, we now know that the local structure of the active metal varies and also affects the catalytic activity in sequential propane dehydrogenation steps. Not only does the combination of three techniques in one operando XAS setup emphasize the range of possibilities in this system, but it also provides a means to study similar catalytic systems.

Batteries:
Cells, which use chemical transformations as the basis for electrochemical energy storage, are of great interest currently in the rechargeable battery market. Of particular importance is the Li-S battery, which offers up to five times higher energy density than Li-ion batteries. Li-S batteries operate on the basis of lithium dissolution at the anode forming polysulfide salt species (i.e., Li 2 S, Li 2 S 2 , and Li 2 S 3 ) during discharge and plating out on charging2À is produced at the expense of S 4 2À , propagating "the oxidation of Li 2 S into more stable Li 2 S 6 "(Fig.It is clear that operando XAS is an excellent method to study and relate what actually happens inside the electrochemical cell and how it performs. Given the varying species formed during each charge and discharge cycle, XAS is one of the best techniques available to observe their oxidation state and local structure. Cell design is of course vital in this case, because in order to obtain true performance analysis, the cell must be as close as possible to a real working system, whilst allowing the simultaneous penetration of X-rays. These results briefly described here, now show the in depth mechanisms of sulfur redox chemistry during cycling, and how these affect the batteries' capacity. Not only can these results be used to enhance the efficiency of Li-S batteries, but operando XAS can be applied to understand and draw links with similar systems, such as cobalt-based batteries.

Sensors:
Gas sensors applied to reducing gases are traditionally based on porous SnO 2 , with noble metals such as Au, Pd, and Pt added to enhance the sensitivity/stability and decrease the operation temperatureGiven that previous studies were focused on samples under idealistic conditions and/or on model catalysts, the information provided by operando XAS here is evidently valuable to enhancing our understanding of the mechanistic aspects of gas sensors. We are now able to observe the oxidation state of the noble metal as well as the metal oxide during true sensing conditions. Understanding the gas sensing mechanism has important advantages in the development of future sensing materials.

Fuel Cells:
Fuel cells in the form of proton-exchange-membranes (PEMs) are widely thought as replacements to current environmentally damaging automobile systemsIn 2012, the group of Tada et al. made another breakthrough in the field of operando XAS on MEA-based polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs)The determination of the origin of surface adsorbates and even their coverage during the operation of a fuel cell has provided new insights into the kinetic and mechanistic aspects during working conditions. Using an operando XAS technique,

Conclusions and Future Perspectives:
The significant interest in operando XAS studies since the start of the twenty first century, together with the continuing development of proper spectroscopic-reaction cells and advancements in synchrotron facilities able to perform such experiments, has paved the way to enhancing our understanding of important reaction systems. Under our definition of operando XAS, whereby the simultaneous online analysis of performance is coupled with chemical/physical information obtained using XAS, we have provided a glance at several current systems available in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, as well as in batteries, sensors, and fuel cells (Fig.Given the topic of heterogeneous catalysis as an example, ex situ and in situ XAS studies do not provide sufficient detailed insight into the molecular-level structure-activity (performance) relationships during true working conditions. This is due to a number of factors, but is mainly due to the absence of the relevant reaction environment that the catalyst actually operates under, when in a real reactor. Operando XAS provides a means to form such experiments and conclusions, but is considered highly complex, due to the multiple time and/or length scales that have to be monitored.The case studies we describe in this chapter show that such obstacles can be overcome to a large extent, and provide new information that is furthering our understanding of how these functional materials operate, which can lead to better process efficiency for example. Although online analysis of the performance is necessary for operando XAS experiments, it is clear that a combination of multiple techniques (not only XAS), such as UV-Vis, Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy are also required to form the complete picture of the chemical and physical processes taking place. One of the focal points of each case study in this chapter (in terms of obtaining such operando XAS systems) is in the design of the spectroscopicreaction cell. Depending on the true reaction conditions required, together with the information desired, the reactor cell plays a pivotal role in allowing for instance harsh reaction conditions (i.e., high pressure/temperature) accompanied by X-ray and spectroscopic working parameters.The crucial information obtained in each case study points towards the vast advantage operando XAS has over ex situ and in situ studies. However, we are still only at the beginning of our development of operando XAS systems. Further enhancements in obtaining spatiotemporal information is desperately required in order to gather greater insight into intermediate species formed on for example the catalyst surface during operating conditions. The studies of Gonzalez-Jimenez et al.Therefore, the continued development of reactor cell design, enhanced dataanalysis, coupled with the development of advanced techniques to improve spatiotemporal resolution, is vital in order to form an arsenal to apply operando XAS on a wider scale to more interesting and complex systems. To obtain XAFS data with a good signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), we should use an edge height (Δμt) of nearly 1 and a total absorbance (μ t t) of less than 3-4. The total absorbance is the sum of the absorbance of the target X-ray absorption edge μ a t and the background absorbance (μ b t) arising from other elements and the other edges, and is given asFor a dilute sample, μ t t may exceed 5 if one tries to keep the edge height approximately 1, owing to the large μ b t. This results in a decreased transmitted beam and a much poorer S/N spectrum. In such a case, the edge height may be reduced even if the thickness increases, owing to higher harmonics and/or stray light preventing the reliable acquisition of data. It should be noted that one has to reduce the thickness to keep the total absorbance less than 3-4 even if Δμt is less than 1 to obtain a better XAFS. With the bright beam source, we can achieve a good S/N ratio XAFS spectra even if the edge jump is 0.1. For more dilute systems, the fluorescence detection method is often applied.The sample is irradiated with higher energy X-rays than the energy of the X-ray absorption edge. The photoabsorption yields emission of a photoelectron and the creation of the core hole left at the target atom. The created core hole is usually relaxed by the transition of an electron from the outer shell accompanied by Auger electron emission or by fluorescence X-ray radiation to liberate the extra energy between the outer shell electron and core electron, as shown in Fig.The fluorescence intensity is proportional to the number of core holes, which is then proportional to the absorption coefficient of the target element. When the target element is randomly distributed in the sample, the intensity of the fluorescence signal can be expressed as:where, I f , I(x), and I(0) are the intensities of the fluorescence X-ray with the incident X-rays at positions x and 0, respectively. As mentioned above μ t can be divided into two parts, μ a and the background μ b , and L is the sample thickness. When the target element is present in a thin film, the equation can be written as (thin film case):If L is sufficiently thick and the target element is very dilute (extremely dilute case) then:In only the thin film or extremely dilute cases, the I f is proportional to μ a , the absorption coefficient of the target edge. Otherwise, I f is not proportional to μ a because μ changes with μ a as it contains EXAFS oscillations. Consequently, fluorescence EXAFS is distorted especially in its amplitude. This is termed the "self-absorption effect" and the fluorescence method cannot be applied. Hence, a dilute sample is suitable for the fluorescence method.  Pt fluorescence appears when the incidence X-ray energy is more than the energy of the Pt L 3 -edge. There are peaks at higher energies corresponding to the elastic scattering of incoming X-rays and Compton scattering. At lower energies than the Pt fluorescence, fluorescence peaks arising from other coexisting element (Fe) are observed.The detection limit is determined by these background X-rays even if one uses a strong X-ray source. Since EXAFS exhibits a 1 % modulation in absorbance for the absorption edge height, a fluorescence of at least more than 10 4 counts is needed to obtain a S/N >1 when only the fluorescence signal is detected (or no background X-ray is present; the signal is 100 ¼ 10 4 Â 1 % and noise ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 10 4 p ¼ 100). If the fluorescence intensity is 10 4 cps, 1 s of accumulation will enable a signal with S/N ¼ 1 and 100 s (10 6 counts) is necessary for a sufficient S/N ratio (10 3 ) to obtain a reliable XAFS oscillation.However, the situation changes when the fluorescence intensity is the same but background components are present. If the background intensity is 10 5 cps, the fluorescence is 10 4 cps, and we want to measure the EXAFS with a S/N ¼ 1, at least 10 s is required because EXAFS oscillation ¼ 10 4 (cps) Â 10 (s) Â 1 % ¼ 1000 while the noise ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffinecessary, a collection time of 10 7 s (7 years) is required. This means that when the background level is high, the EXAFS measurement is not possible even though the fluorescence signal is enough. Importantly, the noise is proportional to the square root of the total intensity and not to that of signal. To reduce the measuring time, the background has to be removed and the signal should be detected more effectively so that an energy selective fluorescence measurement is required.

Lytle Detector [1]:
The strongest background contribution is from elastic scattering X-rays which have the same photon energy as the incident X-rays, while the fluorescence X-rays have a lower photon energy than the elastic signal, as shown in Fig.

Pulse Counting Detectors:
For more dilute systems, the background signal becomes larger and energy resolved fluorescence detection is required. There are several energy-resolved detectors, such as solid state detectors (SSDs), silicon drift detectors (SDDs), gas proportional detectors (GPDs), or scintillation detectors (SDs), as shown in TableThe energy resolution can be achieved by the pulse counting and the pulse height analysis (PHA). When the photon enters the counter, the electron and hole pairs are both created in the semiconductor detectors (SSDs and SDDs). The valence electrons are excited to the conduction bands. The band gap is 1.1 eV for Si and 0.7 eV  for Ge; hence, many electrons are excited by one X-ray photon. The number of excited electrons is proportional to the X-ray photon energy. These electrons accumulate to the electrodes to create one electric pulse from one X-ray photon. Consequently, the electric pulse height is proportional to the incoming X-ray energy. In the GPDs, gases are ionized to create electron and ion pair. The ionization energy of Ar is 30 eV giving a lot of electron and ion pairs, which are converted to an electric current pulse at the electrode. In the SDs, X-rays are converted to visible light where the number of photons is proportional to the X-ray energies and the photons are converted to electrons and finally one electric pulse. The important point is that the final electric pulse height is proportional to the X-ray photon energy. The PHA of each electric pulse created from the detector provides the photon energy information. Since the number of electric pulses for each energy is proportional to the number of X-ray photons, the X-ray intensity (number of X-ray photons) is determined by counting the electric pulses. This method is called the pulse counting method, which is in contrast to the Lytle detector with an ionization chamber, where the pulses are integrated to be a direct current (DC).The merit of the pulse counting method is the energy resolution, which enables us to distinguish between the fluorescence and the elastic scattering. Its drawback is the counting loss when too many pulses enter the detector. Since each pulse has a finite pulse width, two X-ray photons cannot be distinguished when the two X-ray photons arrive at almost the same time. When two pulses simultaneously enter the detector, one signal pulse will be created with its height being the sum of the energy of two photons. Thus, the PHA is not able to identify the pulse as the fluorescence signal and the two pulses cannot be counted. The time that the detector is unable to distinguish between two pulses is called the dead time. If the counting rate is too high, the detector becomes saturated, so the detector should be placed far away from the sample to reduce the total number of pulses and to prevent the saturation of the detector. Note that the counting loss depends not only on the fluorescence but also on the total number of pulses. This means that the intensity of background X-rays (mainly elastic scattering X-rays) has to be small. The pulse counting system is often used with the combination of the low-pass filter and the Soller slit to remove the elastic scattering X-rays.When the counting rate is not too high, the counting rate loss can be corrected. The counting rate loss equation is given as followswhere m 0 , m are the true and observed photon counts of the fluorescence X-rays (selected signal). The n, τ 1 , and τ 2 are total number of X-rays (termed as the ICR (input count rate) or CRM (count rate meter)), and the dead times for the fluorescence X-rays and total X-rays, respectively. τ 1 and τ 2 are determined by a fitting using the following equations:where β is another fitting parameter. TableWhen the sample is more dilute or contains other elements and impurities, higher energy resolution is needed. The superconducting tunnel junction detector provides a high energy resolution detector with 10-15 eV and can be applied to the fluorescence XAFS measurements for low Z elements

Fluorescence Spectroscopy [12]:
Another method for detection in an ultra-dilute system is to use a monochromator to separate the fluorescence of the target element from the other signals. The flat crystal requires a parallel beam to select the fluorescence beam. The Soller slit is used to collimate the X-ray beam, but this results in the loss of many X-rays. Recently, a half-focus polycapillary tube has been used for collecting and collimating the X-rays from the sample, as shown in Fig.When the curved monochromator is used, the X-ray can be collected and refocused on the detector side using a Johan-or Johansson-type crystal, details of which will be in the section of this book discussing the high energy resolution. Sokaras et al. used 40 Johan-type spherically bent Si(1 1 0) crystals to achieve 0.019 of 4π sr radIn a Johan-or Johansson-type monochromator, the monochromator surface is on or approximately on the Rowland circle. The other configuration of the monochromator is a log spiral where the angle between the line from one point to the surface and surface normal is a constantThe log spiral curve is a curve written as:where r, ϕ are the distance and the angle in the polar coordinates, respectively, as shown in Fig.When b ¼ 0, the log spiral is a circle. If θ is the Bragg angle, the diffraction occurs at all points on the curve. Therefore, the X-ray coming from the one spot satisfies the Bragg condition for all points on the log spiral surface, as shown in Fig.where θ B and χ are the Bragg angle and an asymmetrical angle, respectively. The asymmetrical angle is an angle between the crystal surface normal and the crystal plane. The incident X-ray angle against the surface normal, θ, is written as follows, which is constant for all log spiral surfaces:The X-rays are dispersed from the imaginary focal point on the sample side. The Soller slit parallel to the monochromatized X-ray direction can select the certain energy to satisfy the Bragg conditions. The Laue type log spiral analyzer is now commercially available, and is known as the bent crystal Laue analyzer (BCLA)The lower limit of the surface XAFS is determined by the bulk X-ray background. The total reflection is one way to increase the surface sensitivity. However, it requires a large flat surface area as discussed in the other section. A crystal analyzer may be another possible choice to increase the lower limit. We have applied the BCLA to Pt on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite( HOPG ). The Pt density on HOPG was 10 15 cm À2 . Figure

Summary:
To investigate a small amount of a sample, one may use the fluorescence XAFS method which improves the S/N ratio. The detection limit is determined by the background X-rays, such as elastic scattering X-ray, Compton scattering, and fluorescence X-rays from other elements. Exploiting the energy difference of the fluorescence X-rays, one can selectively separate the fluorescence X-rays from other background X-rays. The fluorescence X-rays of the target element can be elucidated by a low-pass filter, the energy resolved detectors (SSDs, SDDs, GPDs, and SCs), and a crystal monochromator. The crystal monochromator has the merit of high resolution. The development of high brilliant photon sources to provide a small spot size will enable the fluorescence method with a crystal monochromator to be used on a practical level for low concentration samples.

Introduction:
"Reflection XAFS" or "ReflEXAFS" is a particular collection mode of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data with the probe beam impinging on the sample in total external reflection conditions. The main advantage of total reflection XAS is that the extinction length of the probe beam is greatly reduced respect to the normal incidence as shown in Fig.In this contribution the basic theoretical aspects of this technique are reviewed and then a list of remarkable experimental apparatuses is presented. Successively, some examples of experiments using total reflection XAS are described, and in the final section some perspectives of development of this technique are given.

Principles of Reflection XAFS:
Reflection XAS (also called GIXAFS or ReflEXAFS) is based on the total external reflection of X-rays at the interface between two media where the deeper one possesses the highest electronic density. If the impinging (probe) beam shines the material below a given angle (the critical angle, ϕ c ) it is completely reflected and enters in the medium only for an extremely thin layer. This is an optical phenomenon widely observed also in the visible range; the difference here is that, in the case of an interface vacuum-material, the former plays the role of the "highdensity" medium. The phenomenon can be understood by considering the refraction index of an idealized system consisting in electrons (mass m e charge q e ) bound to the nuclei via a harmonic potential (spring constant k i ). Neglecting dissipation, the equation of motion of electrons i responding to an external field E 0 at angular frequency ω is m e € x þ κ i x ¼ q e E 0 e iωtÀ ω 2 where i is the sum over all the electrons and N the atomic volume density and α the polarizability. When the energy of the X-rays is sufficiently high that most of electrons are above their resonance frequencies they will respond in antiphase respect to the field (and similarly will do the α) and the resulting refraction index will exhibit a real part slightly less than 1. This and total reflection (lower curve) and a reduction of about four orders of magnitude of the extinction length is evidenced in total reflection. From Ref.Using the Fresnel formulas for modeling of refraction at an interface a complete description of the reflection can be given in homogeneous as well as on stratified media. Definingthe reflectivity R expressed as the ratio between the moduli of the impinging and reflected electric fields is. For sake of simplicity, it is recalled here just some basic simple formulas as the expression of the critical angle as ϕ c ¼ ffiffiffiffiffi 2δ p and the extinction length z 1/e of the refracted beam in case of small incidence angle and negligible absorption. Being δ is a quantity of about 10 À5 , ϕ c is in the order of a few mrad and z 1/e around a few nm.When considering β and δ functions in a condensed system it is clear that the former quantity contains both an atomic background β 0 plus the features coming from the photo-electron interference in the expression of the absorption coefficient (XAS effect) Δβ. Similarly happens for δ in virtue of the KK relation with β. Thus, the reflectivity R as a function of the photon energy E will contain the XAS features, making possible an investigation of surfaces within a range of a few nm under the surface. On the other hand, the analysis of the data appears to be extremely complex due to the nontrivial relationship between R(E) and the quantities β and δ (also known under the name of "anomalous dispersion effects").

Data Analysis Methods:
The first observation of XAS features in a reflectivity spectrum was carried out by Barchewitz et al.linking the two. Considering, however, that the more interesting applications of ReflEXAFS are taken well below the critical angle (ϕ ( ϕ c ) Bosio et al.1þR where X has the same definition as above. Starting with an initial value for δ a first approximation of β is derived, Then, with a Kramers-Kronig transformation KK{β } a second function δ is found that generates β . Carrying out this procedure several times a self-consistent solution is rapidly found.Following the way traced in Ref.ð Þwith the a and b coefficients to be calculated on a model system. All these methods were applicable to semi-infinite solids whereas it was recognized the necessity of treating also the more general case of layered systems. The first formulation of a method permitting the analysis of this class of samples was presented by Heald et al.In the years 2000 together with the interest to layered systems the problem of correctly including the surface roughness become the subject of investigationsBenzi et al.Instead of converting R(E) in a b(E) for successive analysis with conventional tools they proposed the use of modified XAS theoretical paths for modeling the oscillating part of R(E). In practice, the relevant reflectivity parameters (layers thickness, roughness, composition) of the sample are determined by fitting one or more reflectivity spectra at fixed energy (and variable angle ϕ) of the sample. With these parameters, the reflectivity R(E) of the sample is simulated including one at a time the theoretical EXAFS paths generated by a suitable code (Feff in the present version of the code). From this reflectivity function a new theoretical EXAFS signal is extracted and can be used for the data analysis. In this case the full Fresnel (with NC corrections for roughness) formulas are used with no additional approximations also in the case of layered systems.

Data Collection Methods and Instrumentation:
ReflEXAFS is an ideal technique in the study of surface systems especially when real conditions for the surface are required. Coupled with the highly polarized beams coming from synchrotrons, this technique provides a detailed description of well oriented samples. This, because the polarization vector can be oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the surface (linear dichroism) so enhancing the sensitivity to bonds placed along that vector. This effect is different if {K, L (I) } or {L (II) , L (III) } edges are considered. In the former case the relation between the amplitude N Kedge of a single bond making an angle δ with the polarization vector is N Kedge ¼ 3 cos 2 δ whereas in the latter case it is N Ledge ¼ 0:7 þ 0:9 * cos 2 δSeveral experimental apparatuses for ReflEXAFS data collection have been presented in the past. A noticeable instrument is that presented in Ref.A particular challenging topic was constituted by ReflEXAFS on liquid surfaces. In this case indeed, the need of keeping a well stable surface free from ripples and other mechanical instabilities lead to the realization of peculiar experimental apparatuses. The first aspect is that the impinging beam needs to be tilted instead of the sample so the sample stage is preceded by a flat mirror that bends the beam at the desired angular value. Angle variable reflectivity is measured changing at the same time the angle of the mirror and the height of the sample to keep the beam at its center. The issue of ripples at the liquid surfaces is solved by using vibration damping solutions like a floating sample boat placed in a pool filled with a damping liquidAn activity that has been growing in importance in the last years has been that coupling time resolved XAS techniques like Quick-XAS or dispersive XAS with total reflection studies with the aim of describing in time the evolution of surfaces. Using Quick-XASA final remark is to be done on methods based on the standing waves generated in multilayer systems. In this case it was demonstrated the feasibility of data collection keeping the standing wave in the same position respect to the layers during the whole energy scan

Surface Adsorbates:
One of the major investigation fields where XAS in total reflection mode has been applied is the study of crystalline oxide surfaces of interest in catalysis like TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 . In particular, the adsorption site of different metals on these surfaces has been studied. In this class of experiments total reflection XAS reveals to be unavoidable due to the extremely low metal coverage (of the order of 10 À2 Mono-Layers or 10 13 at/cm 2 ) so needing to limit at maximum the penetration of the probe beam into the substrate and minimize in this way the deleterious effects of coherent diffraction. The availability of instruments with full 6 axes goniometers in ultrahigh vacuum for sample orientation has permitted the development of PTRF-XASNi on different Al 2 O 3 surfaces has also been studied upon aqueous phase deposition

Liquid Surfaces:
A further application of polarized total reflection XAS is the analysis of liquid surfaces. In this case, being not possible to change the sample orientation respect to the beam polarization, it was this vector to be moved via a quarter wave plate. It is worth noticing that coupling measurements at low incidence angle (about 1 mrad) on a liquid surface while varying the beam polarization via a quarter wave plate represents a considerable experimental challenge. Studies have been conducted on Zn and Cu porphyrins on air/water and heptane/water interfaces. A marked dichroic behavior was observed for the 1s-4p z resonance peak appearing in the pre-edge region of both metals and that was used to determine the angle of the molecule plane respect to the interface. In the case of Zn

Surface Reactions:
One of the peculiar aspects of ReflEXAFS is that it can provide a probe for the topmost few nm of a surface thanks to the limited extinction length of the probe beam. This has been exploited in a variety of experiments studying the reaction of the surface of a bulk sample with an external environment. Frahm and his coworkers report about a rutile TiO 2 surface intercalated with LiTogether with gas-solid and liquid-solid reactions also solid-solid reactions have been the object of ReflEXAFS studies, in particular the reaction between Al

Thin Films:
As already pointed out in the case of adsorbates, ReflEXAFS reveals its strength in the study of deposited thin films. In this case it helps in minimizing the spurious signal from the substrate (incoherent scattering, Bragg peaks from crystalline matrices) enhancing the contribution of the layer to the total signal. An example in electrochemistry reports on Cu and Cd deposited from aqueous solution on Pt(533) surfaces studied by ReflEXAFS in situ using a specially developed deposition cellA particular case of deposited thin films can be considered also the deposits of atmospheric aerosols or dusts in environmental science studies. The fact of reducing the spurious signal from the substrate by depositing the sample on a clean surface permits the collection of better quality data in cases where the amount of

Materials for Electronics and Optics:
Materials for electronics and optics are frequently prepared as surface or subsurface (some hundreds of Å below the surface) systems. Electronic devices are realized on Silicons by doping with various techniques (ion implantation, vapor phase) whereas surface waveguides are realized on glass in the case of devices for optics. Applying ReflEXAFS to these systems permits to concentrate the beam to the layer containing the absorbing atoms and limiting the propagation of the probe beam in the substrate.Indium doping of Silicon represents a particularly challenging topic as In has a very low solubility in this matrix. The ReflEXAFS at the In-K edge revealed that In implanted at 183 keV and 5 Â 10 13 at/cm 2 (i.e., at the solubility limit) is substitutional with a structure in agreement with the structural simulations, whereas the addition of C leads to the formation of In/C complexes in the matrix

Conclusion and Perspectives:
ReflEXAFS has revealed to be a powerful technique in a variety of research fields from surface chemistry to materials science. The perspectives of this experimental technique will depend critically on the evolution of the experimental apparatuses (X-ray sources and detectors) and on the improvements in data analysis.On the first topic the advent of new rings with low horizontal emittance (see namely the design of the new ring for the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility)For what concerns data analysis it has been shown that at present there are codes for a rigorous analysis of data both in fluorescence and reflectivity modes so data analysis is no longer to be considered as a critical issue. A major improvement could come from an increased quality of XAS signal simulation based on structural modeling as described in the examples above. The wide availability of codes for structural simulation based on density functional theory will help in the interpretation of the experimental data by comparison with fully relaxed bulk or surface structures. But an even more powerful could become the simulation of the XAS spectrum using molecular dynamics

Introduction:
High-energy resolution X-ray absorption refers to the measurement of XANES spectra with the use of a detector signal that is measured coherently with the XANES measurement. The detector signal can be fluorescence, which is known under the name High-Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detected (HERFD) XANES. Similarly one can define High-Energy Resolution Auger Detection (HERAD) XANES.The first HERFD experiments have been performed by Hamalainen and coworkers

Principle of High-Resolution XANES:
In a HERFD experiment, a XANES spectrum is measured with a resolution that appears sharper than the lifetime broadening of the core hole. HERFD spectra are popular for the K edges of 3d transition metals and also for the L 2,3 edges of rare F. de Groot (*) Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis, Utrecht University, 3584 CG Utrecht, The Netherlands e-mail: f.m.f.degroot@uu.nl earths and actinides. The quadrupole pre-edge structures in these edges appear much sharper in the HERFD spectra, see for example the iron pre-edge of Fe 2 SiO 4 in Fig.The main principle of HERFD XANES can best be described assuming a single 1s resonance state at the edge that is linked to a single 1s2p X-ray emission decay final stateThis formula forms the basis of all resonant X-ray processes. The scattering cross section F is given as a function of the excitation energy (Ω) and the emission energy (ω). The ground state (g) is excited to an intermediate state (i), characterized by a 1s core hole via the dipole operator (T 1 ). The second dipole operator (T 2 ) describes the X-ray emission decay to the final state ( j) with a 2p core hole. The denominator contains the binding energy of the core hole state and its lifetime broadening. A resonance occurs if the excitation energy is equal to the 1s edge.The general spectral landscape can be viewed as a two-dimensional space with axis Ω and ω. FigureInstead of normal X-ray absorption, one can measure the X-ray absorption spectrum at a fixed emission energy. This relates to the diagonal line in Fig.If the intermediate state lifetime broadening is much large than the final state lifetime broadening the total HERFD lifetime is approximately equal to the final state lifetime broadening. The Lorentzian broadening thus decreases in comparing normal X-ray absorption and selective X-ray absorption. In case of a single resonance this is a real effect that can be exploited in HERFD experiments.In the case of a series of resonances with, in particular a series of different final state energies, the situation becomes more complex. Figure

Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering:
A general way to present RIXS is by showing 2D plots that provide a comprehensive picture of the 1s X-ray absorption and the 1s2p X-ray emission processes. For quantitative purposes it is, however, more convenient to compare 1D spectral shapes. There are a number of ways one can create spectral shapes out of the 2D images• The constant incident energy (CIE) spectrum, a vertical cross section at fixed excitation energy (7112 eV in the figure). This relates to resonant X-ray emission spectra. • The constant transferred energy (CTE) spectra, a horizontal cross section at a constant transferred energy in Fig.

Valence Selective X-ray Absorption:
If there is a valence shift in the X-ray emission energies of for example Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ , one can use the separate resonances to selective detect the XANES spectra of Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ in the same material. This has been demonstrated for the case of Prussian blue that contains a combination of Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ sites

Spin Selective X-ray Absorption:
Using the 1s3p X-ray emission channel, the main peak and the satellite are correlated with the spin state of the metal ion. As such one can distinguish different spin states in the X-ray absorption spectrum. It can be shown that spin selective X-ray absorption relates to the local spin moment and is essentially the same for a paramagnet and a ferromagnet

Analysis of HERFD Spectra of the Pre-edge Peaks of Transition Metal K Edges:
Over the last years, the use of HERFD XANES has greatly improved our knowledge of the 3d transition metal K pre-edge structures. In short the pre-edges can be understood as follows. For all systems there is the 1s3d quadrupole transition directly into the empty 3d states. This is essentially an atomic transition that has the same strength for any 3d valence hole. The pre-edge fine structure can be calculated with crystal field multiplet models. At higher energy there is the 1s4p dipole transition that defines the main K edge. The main K edge structure can be calculated with, for example, DFT based models such as band structure and multiple scatteringNext there are a few options:(a) If the system is divalent, has a metal ion with inversion symmetry, and has isolated transition metal ions, no additional features are present. (b) If the metal ion has no inversion symmetry, the metal 3d states mix with the metal 4p states. This implies that there are dipole transitions to the pre-edge and the pre-edge intensity will strongly increase in intensity. (c) If the metal ion has a trivalent or tetravalent nature, contains ligand bridged metal sites, and has inversion symmetry, non-local peaks will appear in the pre-edge region. The non-local peaks typically appear at 2.5 eV higher energy, and this energy difference is related to the additional core hole potential of the 3d excitonic states.FigureNonresonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering and X-ray Raman Scattering Timothy T. Fister

Introduction:
In analogy to the connections between Raman scattering and absorption in the optical regime, X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) is an alternative to X-ray absorption spectroscopy, particularly for sub-keV excitations. XRS is the nonresonant inelastic X-ray scattering (NIXS, or NRIXS) from core or semi-core electrons and has a similar energy-dependence as X-ray absorption, albeit with a much smaller overall cross section. However, as a high-energy photon-in/photon-out approach, XRS has found widespread use for samples at extreme conditions, such as high pressure experiments in diamond anvil cells, as well as samples incompatible with vacuum conditions, like many liquids. Compared to absorption spectroscopy, XRS has key technical advantages beyond bulk sensitivity, including lack of self-absorption and the ability to access dipole-forbidden final states in certain cases. It also shares many of the same components as hard X-ray absorption/emission spectroscopy and has found a niche as a complementary technique available at multiple synchrotron facilities worldwide

Physics of X-ray Raman scattering:
NIXS has been used to measure a wide range of phenomena, ranging from acoustic excitations at meV losses to Compton scattering typically measured at keV energy scales. In general, NIXS measures the fraction of X-rays scattered into a solid angle, dΩ, within a range of energy loss, d E f À E i ð Þ¼d hω ð Þ. This double differential cross section is equal to a static contribution from Thomson scattering modulated by the dynamic structure factor S q; ω ð Þ, i.e.,where q is the X-ray momentum transfer and ω is the energy loss term. Using Fermi's Golden Rule, the dynamic structure factor can be written in terms of the electron's matrix element, with a delta function enforcing energy conservation:When q À1 is smaller than the size of the initial (or final) state, Eq. (Higher-order multipole terms in the matrix element give rise to dipole-forbidden transitions that are inaccessible to XAS. This unique feature is discussed in Sect. 17.3. The physical process for XRS is intuitively similar to XAS and is illustrated in Fig.Both the fine structure and atomic background (S 0 ) can be calculated using a Greens function approach analogous to XAFS methods

Measuring XRS:
Even when integrated over all q, the cross section for NIXS is vastly smaller than photoelectric processes for most materials at typical scattering conditions ~10 keV. When factoring in the small amount of solid angle that's typically measured and the Compton background from all other electrons in the sample and its surrounding environment, it's no surprise that XRS was not heavily studied until the advent of third generation synchrotron sources and is still primarily used for experiments where its bulk sensitivity or q-dependence is required. That said, recent advances in the source, optics, and detector technology have dramatically expanded the scope of XRS beyond first-row K-edges, opening up the technique to classes of materials ranging from gaseous samples

XRS in Extreme Environments:
XAS below 1 keV has been largely limited to vacuum conditions and often only probes the surface or near-surface phenomenaOne area previously inaccessible to soft X-rays has been the study of materials at high pressureThe ability to probe low-Z K-edges with bulk sensitivity was recognized as a unique opportunity for catalysts early in the development of XRS

XRS Beyond the Dipole Limit:
Using high energy X-ray scattering to probe low energy excitations provides an additional benefit over soft X-ray absorption: the ability to measure dipoleforbidden final states. XAFS at, say, a K-edge is limited to transitions to p-type final states due to the dipole selection rule (i.e., Δl ¼ AE1). Final states with s-, or dtype symmetry are typically identified by hybridization or via weakly allowed pre-edge resonances. In XRS, these states emerge at higher q, corresponding to selection rules associated with higher order terms in the expansion of the matrix element in Eq.Furthermore, the different symmetry states can be physically separated by measuring the q-dependence of the XRS spectrum. This method was formalized by Soininen and coworkers, who recast the dynamic structure factor in an angular momentum (l ) basiswhere terms in the angular momentum projected density of states are weighted by factors that depend only on the initial state's atomic properties. Using Eq. (17.4), XRS can be used to quantitatively extract the hybridization of the density of states itselfAs an example, this method was used on C 2 B 10 H 12 , an icosahedral molecule that is the most well-known member of the carboranesWhile XRS has been largely used for first row K-edges, it has been increasingly used for excitations from semicore levels from higher Z edges. This was pioneered for L-edges in semiconductors

Quantifying Structure with MD-XAFS:
A quantitative method of interpreting structure in XAFS spectra is available through a first-principles comparison to molecular dynamics simulations (MD-XAFS). The synergy of these two methods can provide important insights into a variety of different chemical systems far beyond what is available from each individual technique. Molecular dynamics (MD) is used to generate a relevant equilibrium ensemble based upon an accurate description of molecular interactions. These interactions are predicted using either empirical potentials or electronic structure in terms of efficient density functional theory, or in principle, from more comprehensive electronic structure techniques that systematically account for electron correlation and weak interaction. The underlying basis for both XAFS and MD is the molecular structure. In XAFS, the positions of atoms about the central absorbing atom of interest are probed by photoelectron backscattering of the ejected core electron. A similar representation of the local atom structure is one of the central entities from a molecular dynamics simulation that is given by the radial pair distribution function, g ab (r). The g ab (r)'s represent the probability of finding an atom "b" at some distance from a central atom "a" of interest. Historically, peaks in the g ab (r) from the MD are compared in a qualitative way to features in the radial structure plot, e χ R ð Þ j j, derived from the XAFS spectrum. However, the MD-XAFS method is a fully quantitative, first-principles method to directly compute the full XAFS spectra using the millions of atomic positions that are part of a typical molecular dynamics trajectory and that represent a thermodynamic ensemble. The point to stress is that this XAFS spectrum, which is generated using first-principles methods (or MD-XAF spectrum), includes contributions from all of the possible photoelectron single-and multiple-scattering events that are a consequence of the arrangement of atoms about the absorber. The resulting MD-XAFS spectrum captures the correlations in positions, angular structure, and geometry. There are several ways in which the MD-XAFS method can be used including (1) gaining insights into the chemistry of the experimental system, (2) evaluating and assigning specific structural features in the experimental XAFS spectrum to atom types or their positions, and (3) validating or benchmarking the simulated MD structure against the measurement. The combined methods of XAFS and MD provide a powerful probe of the structure. Ultimately, these methods improve the understanding of the relationship between structure, fluctuations, energy, forces, and the motions that control the chemical properties of the system.Using the classical method of XAFS data analysis, which is now some 40 years old, the scientist makes logical choices about atom positions for the first-and second-shell atom types based upon an understanding of the expected chemistry of the system. Next, a theoretical standard (e.g., FEFFIn many condensed phase systems, the structures of interest often do not exist in a single state but exist in equilibrium with two or more species. This is especially true in reacting systems where the catalyst can exist as a resting state in equilibrium with various excited states along the reaction pathway. Using classical XAFS methods, the ability to deconvolute these structural contributions in XAFS becomes difficult for equilibria involving more than a couple of different species. On the other hand, when the MD simulation accurately represents the overall equilibrium speciation, then generation of an MD-XAFS spectrum that exactly replicates the experimental spectrum helps verify the fidelity of the simulation and helps in the understanding of the overall chemical speciation.Another factor that has led to the dramatic rise and adoption of the MD-XAFS method is the high structural fidelity of density functional theory electronic structure (DFT)-based molecular dynamics for probing diverse chemical systems at modest size length scales. Historically, the interaction between atoms and molecules was represented using empirical functions such as the Lennard-Jones function modified in various ways to treat atomic charge and longer range electrostatic interactions. The structural parameters in the Lennard-Jones representation are optimized through a process of fitting to various micro-and macroscopic experimental properties. In this way, it is possible to achieve a reasonable representation of pairs of molecular interactions. The DFT-based MD methods advance this process in two major ways. First, the interatomic interactions are a response to the electronic structures of the individual atoms in the simulation. Equally important, for systems that contain a multitude of different chemical components, DFT-MD methods properly treat all the possible pair interactions without a need of developing a new empirical potential for each atom-atom type. This fact enables studies of systems with great chemically complexity or systems that are undergoing chemical reactions. Even within the last 5 years the fidelity of DFT-MD methods has experienced a dramatic improvement that in many instances achieves a nearly quantitative representation of the structural features in the experimental system.The XAFS region is commonly split into x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) and the extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) regions. For both of these spectral regions the overall process of converting an MD ensemble into an XAFS spectrum using that appropriate x-ray absorption theory is nearly identical. In this chapter, the focus is solely upon generation of EXAFS spectra from the MD ensemble; however, there are many equally interesting opportunities for XANES analysis that will not be covered in this discussion.

Recent Literature Highlights:
Early studies using molecular dynamics directly coupled to an electron multiplescattering calculation (MD-XAFS) to better understand the XAFS signal, involved the analysis of the complex solvation of ionic species such as Sr 2þ , Br À , Ni 2þ , Cu þ , and Cu 2þThese approaches found limited success. It was a challenge for the empirical potentials to both recover the measured ion-water bond distance as well as the Debye-Waller factor. With the development of density functional theory (DFT) electronic structure driven sampling, more complex molecules such as UO 2 2þ and metals Ag þ , Zn 2þ , Ce 3þ , U, Ca 2þ have become routineOther studies of ion solvation using MD-XAFS include testing of nonempirical cation-water potentials for aqueous Cr 3þ and of Ir 3þFor MD-XAFS, the balance between the bond distance and the Debye-Waller factor appeared to be resolved with the use of DFT sampling. This was demonstrated for a series of transition-metal ions18.2 Theory: Calculating an XAFS Spectra from MD Simulation

The Process of Generating an MD-XAFS Spectrum:
The method used to generate an XAFS spectrum from a molecular dynamics simulation is shown conceptually in Fig.wherein F(k), φ(k), and λ are the scattering amplitudes, the photoelectron phase shifts, and the photoelectron mean free paths, respectively, as calculated by FEFF9For each individual snapshot, approximately 10 3 relevant scattering paths (SS and MS) are included. The trajectories typically contain several thousand frames or snapshots and thus an ensemble average of greater than approximately 10 6 scattering events is accumulated in the resultant MD-XAFS spectrum. It is important to emphasize that the MD-XAFS methodIn the sections that follow several aspects of MD-XAFS that are useful in the interpretation of various structural feature are described. In this way, the MD-XAFS spectrum can be used as a diagnostic tool to interpret features in the experimental spectrum. There are multiple ways in which MD-XAFS can be applied. Four of these methods are presented later.

Incremental or Partial Structural Contributions to the Total MD-XAFS Spectrum:
When the atomic structure in local regions about the absorber includes atoms that are at slightly different distances (static disorder), or the atoms contain significant amount of dynamic disorder, or when there is more than one type of atom, it is often difficult to assign a particular feature in the radial structure function, e χ R ð Þ j j, to a certain atom configuration. In XAFS analysis this problem is compounded by the fact that the photoelectron phase shift function (φ(k) in Eq. 18.1) causes broadening of the Fourier transform and displacement of the apparent atom positions even though the true spatial resolution is often equal to that obtained from the best XRD or ND spectra. The use of MD-XAFS offers that ability to dissect the contribution from various atom groups to the measured XAFS spectrum. FigureWhereas the information in the g(r) plot of Fig.An example of this long-range structure is provided in Fig.As might be expected, for the multiple-scattering region in the shorter range region from 3 to 4.1 Å, the inverse-transform q-space spectrum (Fig.

Multi-edge XAFS Evaluation of Multiple Scattering Using MD-XAFS:
There are often limits in the ability of XAFS to discriminate small differences in structure or symmetry. The analysis of XAFS taken at two different edges (e.g., Kand L-edges) can be used in some cases to dramatically improve the structural resolution. For instance, multiple-scattering oscillations at the L 2 and L 3 -edges have distinctly different phase and amplitude functions than at the K-edgeThis multiedge analysis method is demonstrated by the use of MD-XAFS to resolve the hydration structure about the iodate anion in water

Molecular Dynamics XAFS for Diverse Chemical Systems:
Perhaps the most important role of MD-XAFS, when combined with experimental spectra, is to derive a deeper understanding of the chemistry and structure in condensed phase systems. In particular, density functional theory-based MD can accommodate the extreme chemical diversity of many systems by treating the dozens of different intermolecular interactions and their chemical reactions using first-principle methods. DFT represents a powerful representation of molecular interaction that contains an explicit representation of electron charge density and takes into account electronic structure, allowing for an effective treatment of bonding. It is a technique that contains a balance between efficiency and accuracy that enables effective sampling of configurations of systems of sufficient size to be predictive.The sections below provide brief examples of several different types of chemical systems in which DFT-MD simulations quantitatively replicate the average structure in the experimental system. The examples include (1) the hydration structure about aqueous divalent and trivalent transition metal ions in water, (2) the structure of a Rh 4 catalyst cluster while it is active in a dehydrogenation reaction, (3) the structure about an Al atom in two different crystalline solids, and (4) the ion-pair structure of Cl À with hydronium ion (H 3 O þ ) in water.

Transition Metal Ions in Water:
The hydration of transition metal ions is important in catalysis, biochemical reactions especially those involving enzymes and in broad areas of geochemistry. FigureFigureOnly through comparison with a comprehensive series of ions having different interaction strengths is it possible to identify systematic errors that are part of the DFT theory. A large improvement in agreement of the theory was obtained by increasing the accuracy of the pseudopotential from the common default setting. By including the 3 s and 3p functions in the description of the pseudopotential, thereby better describing polarization, there is a large improvement in the predicted first shell bond distance by approximately 0.1 Å. The second factor affecting the DFT accuracy is the level of exchange in the theory. Inclusion of exchange (PBE0) further improved the metal-water distance by about 0.03 Å and also results in significant improvement in the predicted Debye Waller factor for the first shell

Reacting System of Rh 4 Clusters During the Dehydrogenation of Amine Borane:
Another example of MD-XAFS analysis involves tracking the structure of a transition-metal catalyst during (operando) a chemical reactionThe XAFS spectrum for many of these predicted intermediates is quite different from those of the dominant species. The simulation shows that the catalyst is highly fluxional in nature and that the reacting Rh 4 cluster progresses through a broad range of transition states. The DFT simulations thus confirm findings from XAFS measurements that (1) the time-average structure is a Rh 4 cluster, (2) the Rh-B and Rh-Rh bond distances are in agreement with the experimental values, and (3) the primary ligand on the Rh binds through a B and not N (of amine borane). In summary, the DFT molecular dynamics sampling of the statistical ensemble of configurations provides remarkable agreement with the XAFS spectrum measured under reaction conditions. The combination of XAFS spectroscopy and simulation provides key insights into the active site and catalytic reaction pathways.

Alumina and Zeolite Structure at the Al Atomic Site:
All of the previous examples have involved solution-phase or homogeneous systems. The MD-XAFS method is equally useful for solid phase samples (crystalline or amorphous). As an example, the Al K-edge XAFS spectra for two different crystalline materials are shown in Fig.

Chemistry of Aqueous HCl:
The chemical equilibrium between different states can be probed with XAFS under special circumstances when there are a limited number of structurally independent species. MD-XAFS has been used to explore the structure of concentrated aqueous HCl solutions

Summary:
MD-XAFS is such a powerful technique and simulation capabilities have advanced to the point where it is practical to make it a common practice in the analysis of complex systems. It is an analytical probe of structure, competing with other x-ray as well as neutron diffraction techniques. Similar quality information that

Introduction:
Metal nanoparticles (NPs) under several tens of nanometers in size have unique mechanical, optical, electronic, and catalytic properties that are different from their bulk counterparts

Size, Shape, Strain, Support, and Composition Effects on Catalytic Properties:
With the decrease of particle size, the surface to volume ratio increases, shifting the balance between the surface and the bulk energies in favor of the former. Enhanced surface energy is responsible for generating substantial surface strainIn nanocatalysts strain is a ubiquitous attribute of their structure. It dominates the surface and support interface regions, and, in the case of bimetallics, is also present throughout the bulk, due to the size mismatch of two types of metalsElectronic structure of NPs could also be modified through the change of particle size. Lowering the coordination number of NPs causes the tendency towards localization of the valence electrons and gap formation, hence, the transition from metallic (at large sizes) to nonmetallic (in small sizes) properties. Another consequence of decreasing particle size is thus the reduction of the width of valence band and the shift of its center of gravity towards Fermi level which leads to an increase of the adsorption energy of adsorbate and a decrease of the dissociation barriers of adsorbed moleculesNPs with various shapes expose different facets, which may have different properties with respect to catalysis in the course of the same reactionMost heterogeneous nanocatalysts are deposited on supports, which distort the atomic structure of the interfacial layer in contact with the substrate, creating defects, strain at interface and may even change the shape of NPsThe addition of the second metal to monometallic systems was found to be an effective way to tune the properties and structures of nanocatalysts. The possible mixing patterns of bimetallic systems reported in literature vary from random alloys, core-shell, cluster-by-cluster, and other architectures, depending on the elements, their compositions and synthesis conditions

Experimental Characterization of Nanoparticle:
Structure and Electronic Properties: The Uniqueness of XANES and EXAFS X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electron microscopy are commonly used techniques for bulk or surface structure characterization. When particle size is in nanometer range, XRD is not very helpful due to the Bragg peak broadening. Electron microscopy, on the other hand, has very high resolving power, which helps reveal the atomic and surface structure of NPsIn the following sections, we review recent progress in structural characterization of nanocatalysts by EXAFS methods.

Size and Geometry of Nanocatalysts by Coordination Number Analysis:
Historically, the importance of EXAFS for catalysis studiesHere N AA(i) is the total number of the A-A nearest neighbors within the same coordination shell, and N A is the total number of A-type atoms in the cluster. The factor of two in Eq. (19.1) is due to the fact that each atom of the A-A pair is an absorber and thus the number of these pairs should be doubled in calculating the A-A coordination numbers. Coordination numbers are obtained model-independently from data analysis of experimental EXAFS spectra. The most important information that is available via the coordination number analysis is the average particle size, and several methods are available for its determination from the EXAFS coordination numbersOne such method, developed by Calvin et al.In Eq. (19.2), r i is the distance between the absorbing atom and neighboring atoms in the ith shell, and N bulk(i) is the ith shell coordination number of bulk structure. This method allows the calculation of coordination number of an arbitrary coordination shell as a function of the cluster size, which in principle, can be used to discriminate between symmetric (quasi-spherical) and asymmetric clusters if the coordination numbers of the higher-order shells are measured by EXAFS. One disadvantage of this method is that it is limited to sufficiently large clusters (with number of atoms much larger than 100)Another useful method for estimating cluster size is comparing the first nearest coordination number (N 1 ) obtained from EXAFS analysis against model structures with known geometrical characteristics. For regular polyhedra (e.g., a cuboctahedron or an icosahedron), N 1 is a function of cluster order L, which is defined as the number of spacing between adjacent atoms along the edge (see example of L ¼ 2 in Fig.For truncated cuboctahedron with atom numbers of 10 (L ¼ 1), 37 (L ¼ 2), 92 (L ¼ 3), and 185 (L ¼ 4), the first nearest coordination numbers are 4.8, 7.0, 8.2, and 8.9, respectively. Another method that is useful in the case when there is no particular symmetry known in advance, and/or nearest neighboring shells cannot be easily identified but the coordinates of atoms in the cluster are available from, e.g., first principle simulations, is the radial distribution function (RDF) methodwhere ρ i (r) is the partial RDF for an atom i, and dN i is the number of its neighbors within the spherical shell of thickness dR i . The subsequent calculation of coordination numbers for an arbitrary coordination shell (between R 1 and R 2 ) is achieved by integrating the ρ(r):ρ r ð Þdr: ð19:5ÞCompared to the two methods described above, the RDF method enables rapid calculation of coordination numbers of clusters with arbitrary sizes and shapes. By combining electron microscopy with multiple-scattering EXAFS analysis and data modeling, several geometries with the same sequence of coordination numbers of the nearest-neighbor shells can be discriminatedThe methods listed above for size estimation are strongly dependent on the knowledge of the first nearest coordination numbers that are, in turn, obtained reliably by EXAFS analysis if the bond length distribution is relatively symmetricIncluding multiple-scattering effects to EXAFS data analysis is another way to improve the accuracy for size determination and is also crucial for extending structural refinement of nanocatlysts beyond first nearest bond distance. From the geometrical characteristics of regular polyhedral clusters, the sequence of coordination numbers of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. nearest neighboring pairs of atoms for different types of polyhedra is unique. That uniqueness is used for comparison with EXAFS results, obtained model-independently, for the same coordination numbers (and for degeneracies of multiple-scattering paths) to determine the size, shape, structure, and, in some cases, surface orientation of NPsAs an example of the multiple scattering EXAFS analysis of the cluster shape, we use the structural modeling of carbon supported Pt NPs up to the 4th/5th Pt-Pt shellA more approximate method that also relies on the coordination numbers of higher shells for determining the size and shape of NPs was proposed by A. Jentys

Using EXAFS to Characterize Bimetallic Nanocatalysts:
Methods of high precision synthesis of bimetallic NPs for catalysis and electrocatalysis are actively sought, due to the increased demand to minimize the use of noble metals and for rational design of catalysts with desired activity and selectivity, and increased stabilityThe information on the homo-and hetero-metallic coordination numbers n AA , n AB , n BA , and n BB is available from EXAFS measurements on the absorption edges of both A and B central atomsJust as in the case of monometallic catalysts, multiple-scattering analysis of bimetallic catalysts allows for measurements of coordination numbers within the first few shellsð19:8ÞThe total coordination number can be employed to determine the size and shape using the same methods applied to monometallic particles described above.For heterogeneouse distributions, the main question in the EXAFS analysis of bimetallic NPs is to detect a certain architectrual motif, e.g., a core-shell or clusterto-clusterFor alloys with positive tendency to clustering of like atoms, e.g., when either the intraparticle or interparticle segregation is present, the left hand side should be larger than the right hand side:x B : ð19:10ÞFor homogeneous alloys (Fig.The second case we briefly discuss is when the two NP systems differ in the randomness of their atomic distributions. This characteristic will only apply to the homogeneous systems such as two NPs shown in Fig.These two examples illustrate the importance of understanding the short range order and homogeneity of bimetallic NPs when attempting to characterize their structure. It turns out that both of these can be quantitatively expressed using J. Cowley's short range order parameter introduced recently for bimetallic NP analysis by Frenkel, et al.:where x B is the molar concentration of B-type atoms in the sample. As we show below, the Cowley parameter (α can vary in the interval between À1 and 1) can be used to investigate the degree of alloying or clustering within bimetallic NPs based on how positive/negative it is. In many cases, it can be used also as a "litmus test" demonstrating that atomic segregation, of either intra-cluster or inter-cluster type, occurred. We note that this equation has been previously employed in EXAFS studies of bulk bimetallic alloysFor alloys that favor (disfavor) clustering of like atoms, α will be positive (negative). This parameter is therefore essential for studies of alloy-or coreshell, or cluster-on-cluster-NPs that can be characterized by different levels of ordering. Only after the short range order parameter is evaluated, can different models of segregation be compared. In either case, additional experimental information is needed to determine the fine detail of segregation, i.e., whether for example element A is predominantly at the surface or in the core. The analogue of the effect of compositional heterogeneity on the interpretation of the short range order within a "representative" NP is the interpretation of the size of the "representative" NP from EXAFS coordination numbers. In each case, an independent technique is needed, and in the latter case, the average particle size can be measured by electron microscopy.We emphasize that the role of measuring and evaluating α extends beyond merely determining whether it is positive or negative. Even large negative values of α may signal segregation as there is only a finite range α min α 0 in which homogeneous systems can exist

Pitfalls and Artifacts of the Analysis:
In studies of the structure of NPs, coordination numbers are the most important structural parameters that can be obtained from EXAFS analysis. Coordination numbers of the first nearest neighbors (1NN) of X-ray absorbing atoms are obtained by EXAFS analysis very reliably, and are often employed for characterizing nanoclusters in terms of their structure, size, shape, and morphologyThe values of partial coordination numbers are important for analyzing composition habits of heterometallic clusters. For example, depending on the relationship between the partial 1NN numbers and the bulk composition of the nanoalloy, the latter is characterized as either homogeneous (when average environment around each atom is approximately the same) or heterogeneous (when different regions within the sample have different compositional trends, e.g., A-rich and B-rich, or when such segregation occurs within each cluster, e.g., A-rich core and B-rich shell)We now introduce the total coordination number of metal-metal pair, or n MM which is equal to n 1 for monometallic clusters. For bulk alloys, when atoms of type A and B are distributed randomly, their partial coordination numbers are found from the overall compositions:where the composition is defined as:In a nanocluster with random compositional distribution, more accurate relationships should be used:We note that in random nanoalloys, same as in the bulk random alloys,but in the nanoalloys the sum of n AA and n BB is smaller than n MM : We have recently shownWe assume that within each cluster, atoms of type A and B are distributed randomly, but x A is different for each nanoparticle. For simplicity, we consider a Fig.ð19:15ÞIn EXAFS signal, clusters with a greater number of A atoms are weighted more than the clusters with fewer A atoms. We thus write the apparent partial coordination numbers as:These results indicate that the ensemble-average coordination numbers e n AA can be smaller for narrow compositional distributions or larger for broad distributions than the coordination numbers predicted by the equation n AA ¼ xn MM . The reason they are smaller for narrow distributions than the nominal coordination numbers was demonstrated above (Eq. 19.13 and Fig., for which the normal distribution coincides with binomial distribution.In summary, partial coordination numbers in heterometallic NPs can be employed to accurately quantify the intra-particle homogeneity and short-range order for arbitrary cluster sizes and a wide range of component fractions, provided that all the clusters possess nearly identical compositions. If the intra-cluster distribution is completely random but the elemental composition varies widely from cluster to cluster, the coordination numbers measured by EXAFS will point toward either negative ( e n AA < n AA ) or positive ( e n AA > n AA ) short range order, which, in the latter case, can be mistaken for a core-shell motif, among other segregation scenarios, even though all clusters are completely random. The only exception when the apparent coordination numbers coincide with those in the "mean" cluster is when the compositional distribution is binomial. With the knowledge of actual compositional distribution (e.g., using energy dispersive X-ray analysis done in electron microscopy experiment) it is possible to correct apparent coordination numbers for the compositional distribution effects (Fig.

Overlapping Absorption Edges:
Heterometallic systems containing two or more elements with overlapping absorption edges cannot be simply analyzed by EXAFS since the EXAFS at the higher energy edge overlaps with the EXAFS extending from the lower energy edge. This is a particularly significant problem for metals that neighbor each other in the periodic table such as Re, Ir, Pt, and Au, whose L 3 , L 2 , and L 1 absorption edges overlap. Unless these overlapping contributions are disentangled, extracting structural information from the data via traditional data analysis strategies is either not possibleThe problem of overlapping edges in EXAFS analysis is not limited to heterometallic catalysts, of course. BaTiO 3 is among the most extensively studied perovskites, yet its EXAFS studies are complicated due to the overlap of Ti K-edge and Ba L 3 edge. B. Ravel et al. proposed a very original use of diffraction anomalous fine structure (DAFS) technique to deconvolute the EXAFS signals from Ti and BaMenard et al. reported a new method for deconvolution of overlapping absorption edges that is based on the use of concurrent, multiple edge analysis of EXAFS data from each edge(3) the Pt EXAFS in the Pt L 3 edge. Because (1) and (Ir e À2R Ir =λ Ir k Ir ð Þ :

ð19:18Þ:
The factor A ¼ Δμ 0,Ir /Δμ 0,Pt , where Δμ 0,Ir and Δμ 0,Pt are the changes in the absorption at the edge steps, is necessary because the extraction of χ(k) includes a normalization to these edge steps. The nonlinear least squares fitting of experimental data to Eqs. (19.17 and 19.18) should be done concurrently to the overlapping L 3 edges and can be achieved using available EXAFS analysis tools. In ref.

Outlook and Future Developments:
With the ongoing development of X-ray absorption spectroscopy techniques, the opportunities for investigation of mechanisms of catalytic reactions employing nanoscale metal catalysts are growing and new challenges, previously ignored or overlooked, come to the surface. One such important challenge is the heterogeneity of the NP ensembles that is evident even in samples with narrow size and compositional distributions and is a common property of real catalysts with large compositional gradients. That heterogeneity, when ignored, causes artifacts in data analysis, as demonstrated above in the case of the compositional heterogeneity, and is also shown by Yevick and FrenkelOne possible solution is the single nanoparticle spectroscopy studies by XAS methodsStudying nanocatalysts at the single-nanoparticle level and in operando mode adds more challenges. For spectroscopic methods, the key is to increase particle sensitivity and for electron microscopic methods it's to enable realistic working conditions. In most electron microscopy studies of catalysis, they were either investigated in an ex-situ mode, i.e., catalysts were pretreated elsewhere under controlled conditions of atmosphere, pressure and temperature, while measured under high vacuum at low temperatures, or under simulated working conditions with lower temperature and pressure compared to the real onesIn conclusion, with the development of XAFS instrumentation and analysis methods, the understanding of structure of nanoparticle catalysts is advanced from qualitative pictures of the mid-70s to much more quantitative ones that are capable to capture fine architectural and compositional details, and account for interparticle and intraparticle heterogeneities. More achievements are expected in the coming years, owing to the reduced beam sizes, improved energy and time resolutions, and new developments in the combinations of XAFS with complementary imaging and scattering methods in operando conditions.

Introduction:
Oxide materials find widespread application in industry, for example as semiconductor, solar cell, catalyst, and sensor. New materials and applications continue to be reported, which is a main driver for technological development and slowly makes our society more sustainable. The function of these materials strongly depends on their structure, which is why their structural characterization receives much attention.Zeolites are an important class of microporous crystalline oxides and they find widespread application as catalyst and catalyst support.X-ray absorption-based methods have played an important role in determining the structure of the framework and extra-framework species in the zeolite structure, as recently summarizedA second major research field of copper-exchanged zeolites is the selective conversion of methane to methanol. Because of the higher reactivity of methanol compared to methane, the direct conversion of methane to methanol using oxygen is restricted to low conversion, because of carbon dioxide formation

Brief Historical Overview:
Copper-exchanged zeolites have been widely investigated after the discovery in the early 90s by the Iwamoto groupMore recently, the Cu-exchanged form of the novel SSZ-13 zeolite, with CHA framework and high Si/Al ratio, is attracting a lot of attention due to its outstanding performance in NH 3 -assisted selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO x gases contained in the exhaust fumes from cars and industrial plants, in terms of activity and hydrothermal stabilityThe structure of the Cu-CHA framework has been known since the 70s from the single crystal diffraction studies

Determination of the Local Environment of Cu in SSZ-13 Upon Activation:
Once Cu-SSZ-13 has shown its outstanding catalytic propertiesHydration issue was raised in more detail in the work of McEwen et al.One of the most extensive spectroscopic studies of the Cu-SSZ-13 (Cu/Al ¼ 0.444, Si/Al ¼ 13.1) activation to date was carried out by Borfecchia et al.Most interestingly, the high-quality EXAFS data reveal that the coordination of Cu upon He-activation was further decreased compared to the activation in O 2 . Coupled with the observation that the reduction in He flow appears only at high temperature (T > 250 C), while at lower T the evolution of the spectra is identical to the O 2 -activation case, it indicates that a charged extra-ligand is still coordinated to Cu even at high temperature in case of O 2 -activation. This evidence support the hypothesis of the presence of an OH À ligand in the first coordination shell of Cu (II) as advanced in the IR study of Giordanino et al.The authors have further tested this hypothesis by performing a set of DFT simulations of Cu ions in different places of the framework and using the resulting structures as input for EXAFS fits and for the simulations of the high resolution fluorescence detected (HRFD) XANES and XES spectra, see parts (e) and (f) of Figs.

Understanding the SCR Mechanism:
A large number of studies were devoted in the understanding of the SCR reaction mechanism over Cu-SSZ-13 system. In this regard remarkable efforts were invested into measuring XAS and XES spectra in different reaction-relevant conditions. We can divide such studies into two families The first concerns experiments in truly operando conditions, when the sample is exposed to the complete reaction mixture (including NO, NH 3 , O 2 , He, H 2 O, in some studies also NO 2 and CO 2 ) under controlled temperature. Most often such studies are performed in plug-flow reactors, such as the one described in the work of Kispersky et al.The second strategy consists in probing separately different stages of SCR reaction thus testing the independently developed hypotheses regarding the behavior of the active sites in particular conditions. Such approach allowed Janssens et al.A similar strategy of probing particular intermediate states of the reaction was adapted by the group of GrunwaldtSummarizing, in the past six years, due to the efforts of several independent research groups, there has been a marked advance in the understanding of the structure and reactivity of the active sites in Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst. As shown in this section, a significant part of the insights was gained by the element-selective XAS/XES studies, complemented by laboratory techniques and supported by DFT calculations. Several mechanisms of SCR reaction catalyzed by Cu-SSZ-13 were proposed based on the results of such multi-technique investigations

Methane to Methanol Over Copper-Exchanged Zeolites:
As mentioned, the direct conversion of methane to methanol is very attractive; however, it is difficult. Over the years, a stepwise, chemical looping reaction has been developed over copper-exchanged zeolitesThe copper-copper coordination is indicative of formation of copper dimers or of a mixture of monomers and oligomers. Based on complementary UV-Vis data, a bis(μ-oxo) dicopper core was proposed. Earlier and later proposals have suggested the formation of a mono μ-oxo core to be more likelyThe reaction of the oxygen-activated copper catalyst with methane has been studied by in situ quick X-ray absorption spectroscopy. FigureOverall, oxygen activation of Cu-MOR and Cu-ZSM-5 zeolites yields small copper clusters, mostly suggested to be dimers, that contain oxygen that is reactive towards methane. The thus formed intermediate is associated to the presence of coper(I) and it can be desorbed as methanol using steam. Such step-wise process is a promising route towards direct methanol production from methane

Conclusion:
Cu-zeolites find commercial application in SCR and are promising catalysts for the direct methane-to-methanol conversion. X-ray absorption and emission-based techniques have played and continue to play an invaluable role in determining the Fig.Both NH 3 -SCR and methane to methanol reactions catalyzed by Cu-zeolites are hot topics, as testified by the fact that several relevant works appeared in the literature on in the short period between manuscript submission and proof corrections. Among them we briefly review hereafter the results obtained by four of them. The relationships among the macroscopic compositional parameters of a Cuexchanged SSZ-13 zeolite catalyst, the types and numbers of Cu active sites, and activity NH 3 -SCR has been established through combined experimental and computational analysis across the catalyst composition space by Paolucci et al.

Introduction:
Chemical design of artificial enzyme catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and molecular recognition has been a long-term challenge in catalytic materials research. Metal complexes with well-defined coordination structures around metal centers may resemble active sites/ensembles of metal enzymes in a sense, where organic and/or inorganic ligands coordinated to a metal center significantly promote and regulate not only reactivity of the metal site electronically but also reaction space around the metal center geometrically. The metal center may constitute a single metal atom or a multimetals cluster. As the result, high activity and sharp selectivity under mild reaction conditions can be achieved with metalcomplex catalysts, which may be difficult to obtain on metal particles and metal single crystal surfaces. However, homogeneous metal complexes in solutions tend to gather and decompose during catalytic cycles, resulting in loss of the catalytic properties. Hence, the transformation of homogeneous catalysts to a new class of heterogeneous catalysts with active structures and compositions in a molecular level has been accomplished by supporting metal complexes on oxide surfacesThe new and distinct materials and chemistry prepared stepwise in a controllable manner by using organometallic and inorganic complexes as precursors provide an opportunity for the development of efficient catalytic molecularly organized surfaces. The key factors of chemical design of supported catalyst surfaces are composition, structure, oxidation state, and spatial distribution, which are associated with in situ XAFS characterization . Nevertheless, these issues are still a serious challenge in catalysis and materials research. In this chapter, we attempt to summarize typical examples of chemical design of active structures by supporting metal complexes on oxide surfaces and subsequent structural transformations based on in situ XAFS techniques.

In Situ XAFS Characterization of Designed Supported:
Metal Catalysts

Catalytic Ethanol Oxidation on Mo Dimers on SiO 2:
With supported molybdenum dimers on SiO    surfaces by using mononuclear Nb complex, dinuclear Nb complex, and Nb ethoxide as precursors, followed by chemical treatments

Metal-Coordination Assisted Hydroformylation Catalysis of a Supported Rh-dimer Catalyst:
A fascinating mechanism for the ethylene (ethene) hydroformylation catalyzed by a rhodium dimer/SiO 2 catalyst, which is much more selective (88.9 % selectivity) than a conventional SiO 2 -supported Rh-particle catalyst (5.6 % selectivity) under a reduced pressure at 413 K, was suggested by the detailed EXAFS analysis as illustrated in Fig.

Molecular Imprinting Rh-dimer Catalysts at a SiO 2 Surface:
To synthesize artificial enzymatic systems with high activity, selectivity, and molecular recognition, molecular imprinting methods that can create templateshape cavities with memory of the template molecules in organic and inorganic polymer matrices have been developed thus farSince a template with the same shape as the transition state of a rate-determining step is most appropriate for catalyst design, but it is hard to estimate its accurate structure. Reaction intermediates before and after the rate-determining step may be considered to have similar shapes to the early and late transition states, respectively, and those reaction intermediates can be used as templates for molecular imprinting catalysts. Tada et al. used a ligand of metal complexes as template at a SiO 2 surface for the first time, choosing a ligand of the supported metal complex with the similar shape to a reaction intermediate of alkene hydrogenation as a template molecule as shown in Fig.The preparation steps in Fig.The structures around Rh atoms in the imprinted Rh dimer catalyst were also investigated by EXAFS. Note that the surface imprinting caused redimerization of the Rh-monomer pair to produce the imprinted Rh template dimer with a direct Rh-Rh bond at 2.68 Å (CN: 1.3) at the surface. The removal of the template ligand left the template cavity on a Rh atom in the pore of 7.4 Å dimension in the SiO 2matrix overlayers to form the imprinted Rh dimer catalyst with a Rh-Rh bond at 2.70 Å (CN: 1.2), Rh-P bonds at 2.21 Å (CN: 1.1), and Rh-O (surface) bonds at 2.12 Å (CN: 2.2). The EXAFS analysis indicated the removal of a phosphite ligand per Rh by the molecular imprinting procedure, where the CN of the Rh-P bond reduced from 2.3 to 1.1. This change in the Rh structures in the imprinting processes was also explained by DFT calculation

Single-Site Zeolite-Supported Ir Carbonyl Complexes:
A family of HY zeolite-supported cationic organoiridium carbonyl complexes was formed by reaction of Ir-(CO) 2 (acac) to form supported Ir(CO) 2 complexes, which were treated at 298 K and 1 atm with flowing gas-phase reactants, including C 2 H 4 , H 2 , CO, and D 2 O. Mass spectrometry was used to identify effluent gases, and FT-IR and XAFS were used to characterize the supported species, with the results bolstered by DFT calculations

Single-Site d 0 -Zr Heterogeneous Arene Hydrogenation Catalysts:
Structural characterization of the active sites on solid catalyst surfaces is frequently tenuous because their fraction among all sites typically is quite low. This problem has been overcome by supporting appropriate metal complexes on suitable support surfaces followed by chemical treatments in a controlled mannerZr K-edge XAFS data for neat Cp 2 Zr(H) 2 and Cp*Zr(CH 3 ) 3 /AIS were measured under strictly anhydrous/anaerobic conditions, but attempts to fit the Cp*Zr(CH 3 ) 3 /AlS EXAFS spectrum with models involving four scattering shells, Zr-C(Cp*), Zr-CH 3 (Cp*), Zr-CH 3 , and Zr-O, were complicated by the overlap of the scatterers arising from the insignificant differences in both bond distances and phase shift and amplitude functions. Hence, the EXAFS spectra were analyzed by fitting the difference spectra of the Zr complexes before and after the immobilization on AlS, after exposure to benzene, and after benzene hydrogenation, thus extracting the structural changes while eliminating invariant contributionsXAFS monitored catalytic reaction species for Cp*Zr(CH 3 ) 3 /AlS exposed to benzene, then to H 2 298 K. Fitting of the Cp*Zr(CH 3 ) 3 /AlS/benzene difference EXAFS spectrum revealed $ 3.0 additional carbon neighbors around each Zr center at 2.35 Å (Fig.

Ethylene Polymerization on Isolated Chromium(III) Silicates:
Mononuclear Cr(III) surface sites were synthesized from supporting [Cr(OSi (OtBu) 3 ) 3 (tetrahydrofurano) 2 ] on silica partially dehydroxylated at 973 K, followed by a thermal treatment under vacuum, and characterized by XAFS together with FT-IR, UV-vis, ESR, and DFT. The grafted sites were highly active for ethylene polymerization to yield polyethylene with a broad molecular weight distribution, similar to that typically obtained from the Phillips catalyst. XANES spectra for grafted species 1, 2, and 3 in

Prospect:
Attaching metal complexes on oxide surfaces provides a new class of catalytic systems with advantages of both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts. The catalytic properties of surface site-isolated metal monomers, dimers, clusters, and even monolayers are different from those of metals and metal oxides, and also metal complexes in solution. Combination of the metal-complex attaching with structural transformations, molecular imprinting, etc. on oxide surfaces can design advanced catalytic materials. In situ XAFS characterizations including timeresolved XAFS

Time-Resolved XAFS Applications to PEFCs:
In situ/operando time-resolved XAFS spectra of Pt/C, Pt 3 Co/C, and Pt 3 Ni/C cathode electrocatalysts in PEFC MEAs were measured every 100 ms for voltage cycling processes between 0.4 and 1.0 V or 1.4 V vs. RHE, while measuring electrochemical evens (current and charge) at the same timeThe changes in the white line peak intensities of in situ time-resolved QXANES spectra for the voltage cycling processes were significantly different in both variation range and absolute value between the Pt/C, Pt 3 Co/C, and Pt 3 Ni/C. The :  Combined techniques of XAFS with other physical techniques, such as timeresolved XRD, in situ HAXPES (hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), x-ray computed Laminography, x-ray CT (computed tomography), STEM-EDS, etc., may also provide excellent opportunities for deeper and unprecedented understanding of key issues and mechanisms for the performance and degradation of fuel cell electrocatalyst layers. In this section, the application of the same-view nano XAFS/ STEM-EDS technique to polymer electrolyte fuel cells is briefly summarized. Spatially nonuniform degradation of Pt/C cathode catalysts in PEFC was successfully imaged by a combination of nano XAFS and STEM-EDS techniques in the same-view mode under humid N 2 ambient equivalent to in situ MEA conditionsPt L III -edge nano XAFS spectra were measured at Spring-8 BL36XU by using a SiFigureFigure

Prospect:
In situ, time-resolved and spatially resolved (imaging) XAFS techniques may provide key issues and mechanisms affecting the performance and durability of cathode electrocatalysts in fuel cells, which cannot be addressed definitely and directly by other techniques. The advanced XAFS techniques are promising tools to present real-time structural kinetics/dynamics of potential-dependent surface reactions on cathode electrocatalysts and spatial mapping of time-dependent chemical changes of Pt nanoparticles under various electrochemical conditions in a nondestructive manner. The XAFS techniques can be consorted with other new techniques such as in-situ 3D X-ray Laminography, 3D XCT, ambient-pressure HAXPES, etc. (see Chapters 1, Chapter 10, Chapter 11, and Chapter 12)

Since hard X-rays are highly penetrative, one can easily perform in situ XAFS experiments in the hard X-ray region during charge and discharge with the transmission mode. The oxidation states and the local structures of transition metals, such as Mn, Co, Ni, are revealed by the conventional XAFS technique, by using an aluminum-coated laminate pack or a home-made electrochemical cell. This in situ XAFS method has been actively used for the analysis of a variety of new electrodesCombining a highly brilliant X-ray beam with a 2D detector, one can get the depth-profile information. FigureThe reflective index of the X-ray is slightly less than unity. Thus, if a highly collimated X-ray beam is incident to a flat surface at an angle less than the critical angle, it is totally reflected with a very shallow penetration in the sample. Since the penetration depth is as small as a few nanometers, one can probe only the surface information of the electrode under the condition. This total reflection XAFS has Combining a broad X-ray beam with a 2D detector, in situ 2D imaging XAFS can be realized for the battery analysisElectrochemical reaction dynamics is one of the important issues of batteries. Quick scanning XAFS spectroscopy has been applied to study high rate delithiation behavior of an electrodeCharge and discharge processes sometimes cause structural change, phase transformation, or cation mixing in the Li and 3d transition metal layers. Combined use of XAFS and XRD is effective to study such a complicated case. However, in general, XRD and XAFS experiments are performed independently at different beamlines. Recently, Tokuda et al. constructed a beamline in SPring-8 which enables us to perform XRD and XAFS simultaneously, as shown in Fig.Due to the low penetration depth soft X-rays, in situ XAFS is challenging. We have to develop a special cell for the operando analysis of XAFS. Here, the key factor is to find a thin and vacuum-tight X-ray window. A typical electrochemical cell is shown in Fig.

Depth-Resolved XAFS:
Takamatsu et al. studied local structures of a LiCoO 2 thin film at the solid electrode/ electrolyte solution interface by the depth-resolved XAFS, described in the previous section

XAFS in the Soft X-ray Region with Three Detection Modes:
As described in the previous section, simultaneous use of PEY, TEY, and PFY modes in the soft X-ray region can probe both surface and bulk structures of batteries. Since deterioration of an electrode usually starts from the surface, XAFS experiment with these three modes provides useful information. Yogi et al. studied the effect of adding lithium bis(oxalate) borate (LiBOB) to the electrolyte on the cyclability of the LiCoO 2 electrodeFigure

Combined Use of XAFS and XRD:
XRD is a method for structural analysis, while XAFS provides information of valence and local structure around X-ray absorbing atoms. Thus, the combined use of XRD and XAFS is a powerful technique to study the atomic and electronic structures of the electrode, especially their changes during charge/discharge. Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4 ) is an olivine-structured material and is known to be a promising cathode because of its high thermal and chemical stabilities, high charging rate, and low cost. Many research works have been focused on the elucidation of high rate performance, but its electronic and structural changes are very unique. Charge and discharge reactions proceed in a two phase manner between LiFePO 4 (LFP) and FePO 4 (FP)With a rate of 1C, a XRD profile was taken at 7100 eV, just below the Fe K-edge, and Fe K-XANES spectrum was taken subsequently at each step. In situ XRD profiles and Fe K-XANES spectra are shown in Fig.

Imaging XAFS:
Imaging is a very impressive and effective technique and has been adopted in various methods, such as X-ray fluorescence analysis, photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, etc. In particular, imaging XAFS is a unique technique for the spatial analysis of a different oxidation state of transition metal species. Katayama et al. applied this technique to trace how charge/discharge of the LFP electrode proceedsChapter 24 Surfaces Hiroshi Kondoh

Introduction:
The XAFS spectroscopy has been applied to studies on local geometric and electronic structures of chemical species at surfaces. In this chapter, the contribution of the XAFS spectroscopy to surface science studies are described particularly paying attention to elucidation of the static structures of adsorbates and in-situ observation of surface dynamic processes.In order to obtain surface-specific information, the electron-yield method is often used in many cases, which includes the total-electron-yield (TEY) method, the partial-electron-yield (PEY) method, and the Auger-electron-yield (AEY) method. Based on the dispersive mode the AEY method has been further upgraded so that the data acquisition time is reduced to be short enough to trace reaction kinetics at surfacesIn the case where a specific element is segregated at a surface, the fluorescenceyield (FY) method is also used for collecting surface-specific information

Surface Electronic Structures:
In XAFS measurements core electrons of a particular element are excited to unoccupied states. Since the core electrons are localized near atomic nuclei of the element, the XAFS spectra provide information on local density of states of unoccupied states around the photon-absorbing atoms. Thus, the XAFS spectroscopy enables us to detect unoccupied states localized specifically at surfaces, if the photon-absorbing atoms are segregated at the surfaces. On the basis of this approach, an unoccupied state localized at one-monolayerthick films of saturated hydrocarbon molecules (C 44 H 90 ) adsorbed on a Cu metal surface was identified by C K-edge NEXAFS spectroscopy as shown in Fig.

Surface-Specific Species:
The XAFS spectroscopy is used for characterization of surface-specific species that are formed exclusively at surfaces. Novel species with unusual chemical bonds could be formed at surfaces via interactions with surface atoms. Although identification of such species is not straightforward, surface vibrational spectroscopies like infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) sometimes play a role in understanding the structures of the surface species. The XAFS spectroscopy is another powerful probe to obtain chemical information of the surface species via probing unoccupied states. Excitations to π * and σ * orbitals of diatomic molecules such as O 2 , for instance, provide information about interactions of the molecules with the surfaces; O K-edge NEXAFS spectra for O 2 -adsorbed metal surfaces at 100 K revealed that O 2 molecules are adsorbed in the form of a peroxo species on AgSolid surfaces sometimes stabilize unstable species. The NO dimer, (NO) 2 with a planer cis-O ¼ N-N ¼ O geometry, is one of examples for such unstable species due to the weak N-N bond (dissociation energy: 2.0 kcal/mol). The NO dimer has been observed on inert surfaces such as Cu, Ag, graphite, and NO/Rh(111) at low temperatures. For the last surface (NO/Rh(111)), the NO dimer layers were grown on a NO monomer layer formed on RhFigure

Observation of Surface Dynamic:
Processes by Dispersive-NEXAFSThe NEXAFS measurements usually require a fairly long data acquisition time, typically several hundreds seconds per spectrum, due to scanning of the monochromator. This prevented from applying the NEXAFS technique to tracing of the progress of surface dynamic processes such as catalytic surface reaction and film growth. However, by the use of wavelength-dispersed X rays and a spatially resolved electron energy analyzer, auger-electron-yield NEXAFS spectra can be obtained in one shot without scanning of the monochromator as illustrated in Fig.Since the dispersive-NEXAFS measurements are performed in an in-situ manner under reaction conditions, it provides an opportunity to find a reaction intermediate if it is a stable and long-lived species. Such a case was found for N + NO reaction on Rh

In-Situ Ambient-Pressure NEXAFS Observation of Surfaces:
The NEXAFS spectroscopy using the electron-yield methods is surface-sensitive due to detection of electrons emitted from the surfaces. However, the emitted electrons undergo inelastic scattering by gas-phase species and the electrondetecting devices such as channeltron and microchannel plate cannot work under high-pressure conditions. The upper limit of pressure allowed for gas dose during measurements of the electron-yield NEXAFS spectra is typically of the 10 À5 Torr order. This is obviously much lower than the ambient pressure, even though practical devices such as butteries and industrial catalysts are usually working under ambient-pressure and even higher pressure conditions, which is regarded as a problem of pressure gap. To bridge this gap, much effort has been dedicated to develop an ambient-pressure-compatible NEXAFS spectroscopy (AP-NEXAFS)

Future Perspective:
Time-resolved experiments using the dispersive-NEXAFS technique will contribute to elucidation of molecular-level mechanisms of surface dynamic processes. In 2011, NEXAFS spectra from submonolayer adsorbates could be obtained every 33 ms continuouslySpatially resolved NEXAFS experiments have been performed by a micro-or nano-beam focused with a KB mirror or a zone plate. Beam damages induced by the focused beam prevent further improvement of spatial resolution. The X-ray photoemission electron microscope technique is also suitable to NEXAFS microscopy for surface species. To improve the spatial resolution the scanning probe microscopy technique has been combined, where the scanning probe is used as a detector of X-ray absorption-induced responses. Since it requires a prolonged time to take a NEXAFS microscopy image, application to surface dynamic processes needs a breakthrough to achieve a much higher efficiency to detect position and energydependent responses to irradiation of X rays.The in-situ NEAFS spectroscopy for surfaces is still under upgrading and expanding the expected application area. Particularly in the fields of catalysts and power devices, in operando observations of surfaces of functional materials under working conditions are becoming more important to understand the mechanism and improve their performances. In this sense, the emerging in-situ NEAFS spectroscopy for surfaces is expected to play a crucial role in studies on such materials. Near future operando observation with XPS and NEXAFS will be a powerful approach to analyze geometric structures and occupied and unoccupied electronic structures at surfaces of a wide variety of functional materials under working conditions.

Introduction:
Knowledge on structural properties is essential to understand the working principle of gas sensing devices based on Semiconducting Metal OXides (SMOX). For sensors, like for many other functional materials, nano-sized structures as well as the nature of surfaces and interfaces define the materials' properties. As will be shown in this chapter, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in terms of X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) was first used to analyze ex situ the powders used to prepare the sensing layers. Later, XAS was employed to explore model sensors containing high dopant loading and exposed to elevated gas concentrations. The current trend seeks to investigate real sensor devices. This implies studies on porous oxide layers with low dopant loading, at elevated temperatures (100-400 C) and realistic reaction conditions such as low analyte gas concentrations (ppm) in oxygen

Approach to Characterize Gas Sensors:
Besides common material characterization techniques such as transmission or scanning electron microscopy (TEM or SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), gas sensing materials are studied by various operando techniques, probing the materials' electronic or chemical properties. DC resistance measurements, impedance spectroscopy (AC resistance), Hall effect measurements, and work function measurements (Kelvin Probe) are common techniques for determining the electronic properties of SMOX sensors under operation conditionsHowever, some of common material characterization techniques are not suitable or are very demanding for operando research since they require vacuum conditions (TEM, SEM, XPS) or long-range ordered materials (XRD); the latter one is not suited for low concentrated dopant structures or unlikely for changes caused by ppm concentrations of analyte gases. In contrast, XAS in terms of XANES and EXAFS provides detailed information on the local structure of both semiconductor materials and also of dopants when they are present. As detailed later, the technique can be used to ex situ study the sensing powder or sensor devices. Furthermore, XAS can also be employed to investigate the local chemical structure of sensors under real operando conditions. This latter approach is of major relevance, since the local structure might change according to the temperature, atmosphere, and electrical polarization.Like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy the analysis of XANES spectra (e.g., by linear combination fitting) can be used to determine the oxidation states of elements. In addition, EXAFS gives direct structural information, but in contrast to XRD not only on long-range ordered materials. For studying gas sensing materials one of the most important benefits of XAS is the possibility of performing experiments under in situ or operando conditions, since the oxidation state and structure depend on temperature and atmospheric composition, or with respect to vacuum techniques the presence of an atmosphere at all. Two major phenomena that take place at the sensor need to be considered: (1) the chemical reaction between the analyte gas and the sensing layer, which is intrinsically a surface process and (2) the charge transfer between the grains, which depends on both grain bulk structure and grain-grain interface. Thus, the response of the sensing layer strongly depends on its structure. To understand the chemical reaction during sensing the XAS experiment has to be designed to mainly probe the local chemical environment of the atoms on the surface. To investigate the charge carrier transfer process, one may easily address the bulk structure by conventional XAS.

Sensing Mechanism: Oxides, Role of Ions and Nanoparticles as Dopants:
Typical SMOX used for gas sensing are WO 3 , In 2 O 3 (ITO), or ZnO, etc., but none of these materials are in both academia and industry as common as SnO 2In the porous sensing layers, which consist of small crystallite grains, the charge transport is limited by the intergrain resistance controlled by back-to-back Schottky contacts, or Schottky barriers (Fig.

Ex Situ Studies on Gas Sensors:
The majority of the XAS studies has been focused on the structure of the semiconductor layer. Since SnO 2 is the most widely used material, there is plenty of information on the local structure of Sn oxide-based materials prepared by different methods such sol-gel, precipitation, sputtering, etc.Although ex situ studies pioneered the use of XAS for the characterization of sensors and set the bases for further accomplishments, we will see in the next sections that chemical environment probed in a pellet is not necessarily the same as the one found under operando conditions. XAS has been mostly used to characterize the powders used to prepare the sensitive layers; in this case, the samples are usually measured as pressed pellets diluted in cellulose, boron nitrideRegarding the detection mode, the choice follows the traditional experimental conditions. In case of powders, if the concentration of the noble metal dopant allows, the transmission detection mode has been preferred. If the noble metal dopant concentration is too low to acquire a reasonable transmission XAS spectrum, or if the experimentalist intends to study the sensing layer, which is usually deposited on the top of a thick substrate (silicon, Al 2 O 3 , etc.), other detection modes such as X-ray fluorescence or electron yield might be considered. Total electron yield was successfully used to study nondoped SnO 2 sensing layersX-ray fluorescence detection mode can be easily implemented to study sensors, this mode has two important advantages: (1) operando measurements under reaction conditions can be performed since hard X-rays are not significantly absorbed by the atmosphere and (2) depending on the roughness of the surface grazing incidence detection mode results in surface sensitivity.

In Situ Studies on Chemical Sensors:
Although the conditions faced by in situ studies are much more challenging than those for ex situ measurements, in situ studies are carried out with model sensors. It means that the dopants and gas concentrations are much higher than those found for real sensor devices. For example, in the called model sensors, the wt% of dopants may reach two digits of magnitude and gases are also in the order of v/v%, whereas in real devices these values may be smaller than 1 wt% and gases in the order of few ppm (v/v).The degree of complexity of the experiments also depends on the state of the art of the X-ray sources and detectors. As brighter sources and detectors with lower detection limits have been developed more realistic sensor devices and conditions can be explored. Hence, the results of in situ studies might be carefully interpreted since they might give a flavor of the sensing mechanism but not the actual mechanism.Once chosen the detection mode and conditions of the experiments (e.g., gases, humidity, or temperature) one has to decide what kind of cell/test house should be employed to address the raised questions. In situ studies have proved to be especially important when one seeks to investigate the role of dopants. From historical perspective XAS was first used to investigate the influence of the gas atmosphere on the chemical environment of sensor materials such as dopants and semiconductors, this we have called in situ studies. Later then XAS was combined to electrical measurements that allowed investigating the local order of atoms and simultaneously recording the electrical response of the sensor; these are the operando studies.In situ measurements can be carried out exposing the sensor powders or devices to an atmosphere containing the analyte gas, such as CO or H 2 . An example of such a type of study was reported by Davis et al.

Operando Studies on Chemical Sensors:
As stated before, operando studies seek to investigate the sensor devices as close as possible of its real working conditions, i.e., very low dopant and probe gas concentrations. In commercial devices dopants are usually noble metals such as Pt, Pd, or Au; thus they are employed in the minimum required concentration. One of the major challenges for in situ and operando measurements consists in the development of a reaction cell that would allow recording XAS spectra and at the same time controlling the atmosphere (cf. Chap. 6), temperature and ideally registering the electrical response given by the sensor device. An example of a successful design is presented in Fig.XAS experimentalists must also be aware that the X-ray beam may heat the sensor or change the semiconductor electronic transport properties. Luckily, the parallel recorded resistance allows one to assess to which extent the beam exposure affects the sensor performance. In some cases recording XAS for sensor devices can be very challenging. Let us consider the example of a sensitive layer doped with Pt. The electrodes shown in Fig.Pt L 3 edge is located at 11,564 eV while Au L 3 edge appears at 11,919 eV. Therefore, using a conventional energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (resolution ΔE/E 0.01-0.03, c.a. 100-300 eV) detector is impossible to record a 1000 eV EXAFS spectrum for Pt without detecting the Au edge appearing in the middle of the spectrum of Pt. One way to circumvent this inconvenient consists in recording the EXAFS spectrum in High Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detection (HERFD) mode

Ex Situ Studies: Doped Oxides, Sensor Devices or Sensor Powders:
A typical example of ex situ analysis of powders used to produce sensors was given by Kanai et al.Complementary to the powder approach, the ex situ analysis of the sensor device may also provide important structural information. It can capture any structural changes that might have occurred during the deposition of the powders on the electrodes. A very instructive case was presented by Serrini et al.

Examples for In Situ and Operando Studies:
One of the first investigations for in situ measurements was carried out by Gaidi et al.Simultaneous XANES and electrical measurements on similar Pt-doped SnO 2 samples were later reported by the same groupFurther operando studies using even harsher conditions were more recently reported for Pt, Au, and Pd-doped SnO 2 . One should keep in mind that real sensors might present very low concentration of noble metal dopants, i.e., significantly lower than 1 wt%. Moreover, the sensing layer is porous and thin, c.a. 50 μm as shown in Fig.Au-doped SnO 2 was also investigated using HERFD-XANESFinally, one of the most recent operando XAS studies on sensor reported by our group dealt with 0.2 and 1 wt% Pd-doped SnO 2 prepared by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) and powder impregnation (PI) methodsBesides the method employed to obtain the Pd-SnO 2 powder, the procedure used to make the sensing layer plays a major role in sensing properties and chemical environment of Pd under working conditions. Directly deposited FSP layers are more porous than screen-printed ones; thus Pd atoms were partially reduced under 50 ppm H 2 . FSP and PI layers deposited by the screen-printed method resulted in modest reduction (<10 %) of Pd under working conditions. Under reducing conditions PI samples were almost completely reduced whereas in FSP a fraction of Pd (nearly 20 %) persisted oxidized. This was interpreted as an indication that part of the Pd atoms obtained by the FSP method was incorporated within the SnO 2 lattice, the absence of higher shells in EXAFS also pointed out that Pd atoms are well dispersed on the surface, and those incorporated by SnO 2 might be in highly disordered environment.

Present Trends and Outlook:
One of the key parts for operando studies in the field of sensing but also related fields, such as catalysis, is the design of in situ cells (cf. Chap. 6). As it is always aiming at the best compromise to study the structure and the sensor performance, new operando studies need to be constructed depending on the system of interest. Additionally, the combination of XAS with further spectroscopic techniques, e.g., IR, Raman, or UV/vis, will be of great interest. On the one hand from one experiment more information is available, which is also a trend in catalysis. On the other hand, the X-ray exposure may influence the material and alter the results, e.g., local heating or electronic effects. Since during all operando spectroscopic experiments the DC resistance of the sensor is recorded, separate experiments can be compared on the basis of the DC measurements afterward. This approach avoids mutual effects of the radiation, but surely doubles the effort for the measurements. Alternated recording XAS and other techniques are still time-consuming and not favorable regarding the limited access to suitable X-ray sources.Additionally to the atomic local chemical environment, i.e., coordination numbers, atomic distances, and mean square deviation of atomic distances probed by XAS, one can draw attention to the electronic structure, i.e., probing the valence orbitals. Typically, the structure of the electronic outer shells is explored by UPS and soft X-ray techniques, which eliminate the possibility of carrying out operando studies since these tools require vacuum conditions. New photon-in/photon-out techniques based on hard X-rays have, however, recently become available which allow probing the electronic structure of valence orbitals under operando conditions. Such methods, for example X-ray emission spectroscopy, have now also been applied on realistic samples at various synchrotron radiation facilities

Conclusion:
XAS applied to gas sensors provides a good example for how this spectroscopic technique can be used to unravel structure-function relationships. The wellestablished procedures, e.g., sample preparation and cell design, make it easier to transfer these concepts to other fields of materials science. diversity and flexibility in composition (see below Figs.Completely different frameworks can be obtained by keeping the same linker connectivity and changing the cornerstone geometry, see Fig.Although the industrial application of MOFs is still limited to a few cases(5) optical and luminescent materialsAs deeply described in several authoritative reviews and book chaptersMOFs functionalization (see Fig.

Relevance of XAS-Techniques in Understanding the Structure and the Reactivity of MOFs Materials:
The fact that MOFs are mainly constituted by low Z elements (C, O, N, H) implies that they are almost transparent to hard X-rays;

The desolvation process left almost unchanged the XRPD pattern of such materials:The inorganic cornerstones of the as synthesized materials are perfect M 6 (OH) 4 O 4 octahedron (see model in Fig.Summarizing, EXAFS spectroscopy allows to detect the evolution from M 6 (OH) 4 O 4 to M 6 O 6 (M ¼ Zr or Hf) of the inorganic cornerstones of UiO-66, UiO-67 and Hf-UiO-66 MOFs that escaped XRPD detection. DFT period calculations support EXAFS data. Only very recently, Øien et al.TableIn particular, the dichlorobipyrimidyl platinum(II), PtCl 2 (BPYM), performs the catalytic oxidation in fuming or concentrated sulfuric acid, achieving high yields of methanol with selectivity higher than 90 %Using EXAFS and XANES, the structural and oxidation state of Pt can be monitored under in situ conditions. The elimination of chlorine ligands from Pt in a continuous gas flow of H 2 have been monitored by EXAFS during temperature ramping, Fig.EXAFS also provided evidence of the liquid phase ligand exchange with toluene-3,4-dithiol (H 2 tdt) and of the liquid phase oxidative addition of Br 2 to Pt, see Also the XANES part of the XAS spectrum Fig.

Optimized Finite Difference Method for the Full-Potential XANES Simulations: Application to Molecular Adsorption Geometries in MOFs:
Over the past two decades much progress has been made in the understanding the features of the XANES region of the X-ray absorption spectraAs already outlined at the end of Sect. 26.3.3 (see Fig.CPO-27-Ni MOFUnfortunately, the CPU needed to perform the XANES simulation scales approximatively with an exponential function of the cluster size, as shown by the scattered squares reported in the inset of FigureThe gain of a factor larger than one order of magnitude (up to forty for the large clusters relevant to obtain a meaningful simulation) makes it possible to perform structural determination from a detailed XANES study. To prove this concept we show that it is possible form the simulation of the XANES spectra to determine the geometry of the molecular complex formed upon adsorption of a diatomic ligand molecule (NO or CO) on the coordination vacancy of Ni 2+ sites in the dehydrated form of CPO-27-Ni MOF. As the spectroscopic difference between the XANES spectra collected before and after molecular adsorption are not very large (see for example the case of N 2 adsorption reported in Fig.

Conclusions:
In this chapter, we introduce MOFs as the new class of crystalline porous materials of remarkable potentialities. We underline the flexibility in the realization of different MOFs and the fact that they are ideal materials for performing X-ray absorption experiments at the metal K or L 3 edges in transmission mode. A selection of relevant results appearing in the last five years follows, underlying the relevant role of both EXAFS and XANES in determining the structural and electronic configuration of metals centers inside MOFs.(1) XAFS provides local structural information independent of the long-range order. Consequently, evolution of the local structure of molecular complexes or clusters that actively participate in homogeneous catalysis can be monitored with ease. (2) XAFS is an element-specific technique. Tuning the X-ray energy to the absorption edge focuses solely on a particular element or metal center of interest and thereby allows study of the catalyst's unique role in the reaction. An additional advantage of this element specificity is that other structural correlations, which arise from spectator entities (e.g., passive solvents), are inherently filtered out. (3) Most catalysts have X-ray absorption edges (one or more) that can be excited using an energy-tunable X-ray source (normally using a spectroscopy beamline at a synchrotron). X-ray energies involved in these measurements are usually sufficiently high that the X-rays readily penetrate the samples and windows in the reaction cell. Most importantly, this enables the measurement to be performed operando-under true reaction conditions. A key to performing such measurements, as will be discussed later, lies in the design and use of appropriate reactors or operando cells. (4) XAFS is highly sensitive to dilute catalysts when measurements are performed using fluorescence detection. This makes it a powerful technique to probe dilute constituents that potentially play important catalytic roles. (In the sections that follow, the objective is to illustrate the power of the XAFS technique and to provide examples of how it has been applied to homogeneous systems in order to gain deep insight into the function of the catalyst. The examples include metal centers having either single-atom species or metal clusters that contain up to four atoms in the core. The overall subject in this chapter deals with homogeneous catalysis, although there is not a well-defined cutoff differentiating a homogeneous cluster from a nanoparticle, rather there is a continuum of sizes that can be chemically relevant. This chapter is not an exhaustive review of the literature, but it is intended to illustrate the power of XAFS spectroscopy in the study of homogeneous catalysis. Several recent examples of homogeneous catalysis are highlighted, including themes of green chemistry, hydrogen storage, and classical hydrogenation chemistry where XAFS has been used to provide completely new understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

There are Limitations:
The method of operando XAFS is used to track the change in the metal center environment, starting with the precursor species and following the chemical conversion to the dominant species that is present under reaction conditions. There is a common misconception that XAFS captures the "active" form of the catalyst during the chemical reaction. In special circumstances, operando methods may query the active state, but more often than not, it queries a resting catalyst state or an equilibrium of different catalyst states. Thus a short-lived transition state that is the true active catalyst might not be detected in a standard XAFS experiment. This is of course true of most spectroscopic techniques. There is also the possibility that the active species is a trace component in equilibrium with a dominant, major inactive state. This situation is exemplified by palladium catalyzed C-C bond formation reactions, such as the Mizoroki-Heck reactionEven with these limitations, XAFS is among the best existing methods to probe the catalyst in a state as close as possible to its active state. In this regard, if at all possible, the chemistry should be formulated in a series of steps to trap or favor the intermediate states. In addition, one should not overlook the often important, complimentary information that is available from other spectroscopic methods such as NMR, IR, Raman spectroscopy, or other chemical techniques such as careful kinetics or poisoning studies. Finally, critical insights can be gained using a parallel effort involving DFT-based molecular structure calculations. An especially powerful approach is the direct computation of an XAFS spectrum (MD-XAFS) from a molecular dynamics trajectory (see Chap. 18 in this volume) that can be used to make quantitative comparisons to the experimental spectrum. Thus operando XAFS probes the catalyst state in a way that is directly relevant to molecular simulation.

Literature Highlights:
Since the advent of modern XAFSSome homogeneous metal catalysts function with high activity when they are present in ultra-low concentrations. Taking advantage of the sensitivity of XAFS to dilute species, Fiddy et al.In an early energy-dispersive XAFS (ED-XAFS) study, Bogg et al.Using a purpose-built freeze-quench attachment in conjunction with the more conventional stopped-flow methods, Barlett et al.Multimodal approaches, that combine XAFS with other complementary techniques (FT-IR, Raman, UV-Vis, time resolved XRD, and so on), are increasingly being used for operando studies. A multimodal approach can potentially provide a more holistic and complete understanding of the catalytic process. In this context, an elegant combined ED-XAFS/UV-Vis study was performed by Diaz-Moreno et al.The role of nanoparticulate gold as an efficient catalyst in many electrocatalytic and heterogeneous catalytic systems has been widely studied using XAFS. In a recent study, Hashmi et al.More recently, Sherborne et al.

Methods of XAFS Acquisition for Homogeneous Reactions:
The choice of method and mode of XAFS data collectionThe focused beam, on transiting the sample, is allowed to diverge onto a position sensitive detector (PSD) where the beam position on the PSD is correlated to energy. This dispersive arrangement affords the collection of the entire absorption spectrum simultaneously; therefore, time resolution in the few milliseconds to sub-second range can be easily achieved. Such experiments are limited, however, to transmission mode geometry and further require highly uniform and concentrated samples. For dilute species, transmission mode methods may not provide sufficient sensitivity, and the use of fluorescence detection is often warranted

Reaction Cells:
A molecularly dispersed, homogeneous catalyst in a chemical reactor that incorporates X-ray transparent windows provides nearly the ideal sample configuration and uniformity for XAFS spectroscopy. There are many aspects involved in selecting the ideal XAFS cell. Many beamlines provide reaction cells that are appropriate for certain classes of systems. However, in order to most efficiently use the allotted beamtime, it is often preferable to build a small XAFS reactor that has been optimized for a particular edge-energy, catalyst concentration, beam properties, and other aspects of the reaction system. X-ray transparent windows and reactor body materials are selected based upon their chemical inertness, the required X-ray energies, and the pressure and temperature of the system. The most common window types include polyimide (Kapton) films (25-150 μm), polyether ether ketone (PEEK) in sheet or machined forms (0.5-5 mm), single crystal or polycrystalline diamond (15 μm-1 mm), glassy carbon (0.5-3 mm), and silicon nitride (50 nm-1 μm). At high energies even amorphous materials such as silicate glasses are appropriate. Glassy carbon is an excellent material, since the amorphous structure does not add diffraction artifacts to the XAFS spectra. Glassy carbon is appropriate for moderate pressures, high temperatures and is inert under most solvent conditionsPerhaps most importantly, comments are given on methods to most efficiently use the expensive and precious resource, that is, the allocated beamtime. There are several strategies that help lead to the best possible outcome while studying the catalyst chemistry at a beamtime. These include: (1) Bring a full range of catalyst and reactant chemistry to the beamline. During the beamtime, as much as possible, make initial structural evaluations from the XAFS spectra as they are being acquired. This allows for adjustments to the experimental plan to accommodate unexpected findings. (2) Develop a complete and detailed test plan and review the plan with the beamline scientists beforehand. Plan more experiments than the time allows, readjusting the agenda to cover failed experiments. Test the chemistry in the XAFS cell before arrival. Make sure that your trip to the beamline is fully staffed.(3) Measure all structurally related standards (typically > 6) that play an important role in interpretation of the XAFS spectra (4) Discuss the overall experimental plan with beamline personnel well ahead of scheduled beamtime in order to make sure that all aspects of the reaction can be operated safely under the constraints of operation in a beamline hutch and the beamline laboratory.  A new, more efficient synthesis route involves the use of high-temperature water as a green solvent

CuCl n:
Water is often an impurity or product in ionic liquid-based reactions. This is the basis for exploring the binary mixture of the [EMIM]Cl ionic liquid with water. FigureFigure2À species persist up to about 80 mol% water. It is only at even higher water concentrations that the Cu 2+ coordination with Cl-decreases and the formation of a partially hydrated Cu 2+ occurs. This behavior is ascribed to the change in the dielectric constant of the ionic liquid/water mixture. Below 80 mol% water the dielectric constant is closer to that of a nonpolar solvent, while above 80 % the value rises rapidly to that of pure water. The types of structural transitions illustrated in Fig.

Rh 4 Cluster Catalyzed Dehydrogenation of Amine Boranes:
There has been intense interest in the development of hydrogen storage materials and their utilization over the past 15 years. One such category of compounds is the amine boranes with the general formula NHR 2 -BH 3 . For these systems a catalyst is required to rapidly and quantitatively release the H 2 contained in these compounds.As shown in Fig.This homogeneous catalyst reaction is an ideal system for operando XAFS. In contrast to the manganese system described above the equipment needed for this operando XAFS study is relatively simple. A small hole drilled into a standard glass vial as shown in Fig.An intriguing finding from XAFS is that exposure of the reaction solution to even small amounts of oxygen (from air) either during or after the reaction led to the formation of metallic rhodium. All attempts to analyze the black precipitate spectroscopically ex situ always showed the presence of metallic rhodium due to contamination with oxygen. It was proposed the Rh 4 ligands (DMAB dimers) are extremely sensitive to oxidation and the loss of these stabilizing ligands leads immediately to the formation of metallic rhodium particles. This example demonstrates the essential role of operando XAFS spectroscopy yielding information not possible by ex situ analysis. The finding of the tetra-rhodium clusters had not previously been postulated in these systems. This new finding led to questions about whether there were other rhodium (and other metal-containing) systems that were actually catalyzed by clusters instead of metallic nanoparticles. This then led to the reinvestigation of a 30-year old chemistry question in catalysis that is described in the next section.

Rh 4 Cluster Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Benzene:
Based upon the above results showing that tetra-rhodium clusters were important in dehydrogenation catalysis, other systems were explored in which there was uncertainty whether metallic rhodium nanoparticles or homogeneous rhodium complexes were the active species. Among these, a system described by Maitlis in 1977 for the hydrogenation of benzene stood out. MaitlisSimilar to the DMAB reaction mentioned above, no metallic rhodium was observed in this reaction systemIn this system the rhodium-to-substrate concentration was initially four times that of the original Maitlis study. This provided an improved signal-to-noise ratio for XAFS. Reactions conducted under the original concentration and conditions also yielded the same results, showing that at least in this case, increased catalyst concentration did not affect the observed kinetics, spectroscopy, or catalyst speciation.Later investigations

Summary:
In these examples we have shown how XAFS spectroscopy probes homogeneous systems to obtain information about catalyst structure not obtainable by other methods. For instance, the unexpected discovery of tetra-rhodium organometallic clusters as the predominant species during the dehydrogenation of amine boranes and the hydrogenation of benzene was only accomplished through the use of operando XAFS. Ex situ techniques were found to yield species not relevant to the catalyst system. The knowledge that rhodium-tetramers were important for catalysis in one system led to the reinvestigation of other systems containing clusters that have not been isolable. In general, careful planning and implementation of XAFS gives a clear view of catalyst structures during the actual catalysis. While XAFS observation of a metal species during catalysis is not necessarily proof that the observed species is catalytically active, it does yield powerful information about the reaction mechanism, especially when combined with other analytical techniques. Unlike other spectroscopic techniques such as NMR and IR, there are no limitations with respect to active NMR nuclei or indirect interpretation of IR vibrational modes that typically have low extinction coefficients.

Introduction:
Nature uses remarkably varied systems and mechanisms to perform chemical reactions with efficiency, speed, and complexity. At the active site of many enzymes are metal centers, responsible for the rearrangement of electrons and atoms in order to carry out electron transfer and catalytic reactions. Some of the representative metal clusters, especially those that contain heterometallic clusters, that are related to important reactions in nature, are shown in Fig.Geometric and electronic structures of metal catalytic centers have been studied with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in numerous metalloenzymes by taking advantage of the element-specificity of X-ray spectroscopy. X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) has been commonly used as a probe of the metal oxidation state, while extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) has been applied for identifying the geometric structure of the metal complexes, and the method does not require single crystals. This makes the EXAFS method a powerful tool for extracting structural information of reaction intermediates, that cannot be crystallized. While solution NMR study is another way to get structural information of non-crystalline biological samples, it is difficult to apply the method to large metalloenzymes (>100 kDa)In addition to XAS, more advanced X-ray-based techniques such as RIXS (resonant inelastic X-ray scattering), XES (X-ray emission spectroscopy), and X-ray Raman spectroscopyIn this chapter, the X-ray spectroscopy methods that have been used for studying biological samples are described, using several examples. In addition to the synchrotron X-ray-based methods, recent introduction of XFELs (X-ray free electron lasers) have opened a new way of collecting X-ray spectroscopy of biological systems by capturing reaction intermediates under physiological conditions, and this chapter touches on some of the applications that have been demonstrated recently.

X-Ray Spectroscopy of Biological Systems:
X-ray crystallography and X-ray spectroscopy of metalloenzymes provide complementary information: crystallography probes the structural changes of the cofactor and the overall protein, while XAS provides detailed information about changes in Fig.In general, the advantage of EXAFS over X-ray crystallography is that the local structural information around the metal of interest can be obtained even from disordered samples such as powders and solution, and usually the metal-metal and metal-ligand distance information is much better than that can be obtained from crystallography. However, ordered samples like oriented membranes and single crystals often increase the information obtained from X-ray spectroscopy. The advantages and the limitations of XAS for the structural studies of biological systems are summarized in detail below.1. In a metalloenzyme with multiple metal centers like cytochrome oxidase (Cu and Fe), photosystem II (Mn and Ca), or nitrogenase (Fe/V and Mo), it is possible to study the structural environment of each metal atom independently, because of the element specificity of XAS. 2. The metal of interest is never "silent" with respect to X-ray spectra, and one can always probe the metal site structure by X-ray spectroscopy. It could be "silent" with respect to EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy), optical, or other spectroscopic methods. However, this could become a disadvantage, if there are several metal centers going through different chemical states. 3. X-ray spectroscopy is not limited by the state of the sample, because it is sensitive only to the local metal site structure. Therefore, one can either trap intermediates in the enzymatic cycle or modify the site by the addition of inhibitors or substrate, or generate other chemical modifications or site-directed mutations. Such samples can be made as frozen solutions, avoiding the problems of trying to obtain single crystals.It is also important to realize the intrinsic limitations of EXAFS for studying structures. A frequent problem is the inability to distinguish between scattering atoms with little difference in atomic number (C, N, O or S, Cl, or Mn, Fe). Distances are usually the most reliably determined structural parameters from EXAFS. But the range of data that can be collected, often-times due to practical reasons like the presence of the K-edge of another metal, or data collection time for dilute biological samples, limits the resolution of distance determinations to between 0.1 and 0.2 Å. Also it is difficult to determine whether a Fourier peak should be fit to one distance with a relatively large disorder parameter or to two distances, each having a small disorder parameter. Careful statistical analysis, taking into consideration the degrees of freedom in the fits, should precede any such analysis. The resolution in the distance Δr can be estimated from the relation that ΔrΔk ~1 (see Sect. 4.2). Determination of coordination numbers or number of backscatterers is fraught with difficulties. The Debye-Waller factor is strongly correlated with the coordination number and one must have recourse to other information to narrow the range that is possible from curve fitting analysis alone.It is therefore very useful to compare the spectra from the complex in the metalloenzyme to some known model complexes and then use Debye-Waller parameters obtained from the model complexes in the fits.

Radiation-Induced Changes During Data Collection:
Damage to biological samples by X-rays is cause for serious concern for X-ray based experiments, in particular for the study of biological samples. However, with the right precautions one can successfully perform these experiments under the threshold of radiation damage. At synchrotron sources, most of the damage is produced by free radicals and hydrated electrons that are produced by X-rays in biological samples. The diffusion of the free radicals and hydrated electrons can be minimized by the use of low temperatures. The use of a liquid He flow cryostat or liquid He cryostream, where the samples are at atmospheric pressure in a He gas atmosphere, has greatly reduced the risk of sample damage by X-rays. XAS experiments require a lower X-ray dose than X-ray crystallography, and radiation damage can be precisely monitored and controlled, thus allowing for data collection from an intact form of metal catalytic centers.An example of the X-ray-induced changes is shown in Fig.Nevertheless, radiation-induced changes remain one of the most challenging aspects in biological X-ray spectroscopy. New approaches to overcome such effects and collect radiation-damage-free data have become possible, using XFELs which is described in Sect. 5.

Polarized X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy:
As described above, the advantage of XAS is that the local structural information around the element of interest can be obtained from disordered samples such as powders and solutions. However, ordered samples like membranes and single crystals often increases the information obtained from XAS. For oriented single crystals or ordered membranes the interatomic vector orientations can be deduced from dichroism measurements. Membrane proteins can be oriented on a substrate such that the lipid membrane planes are roughly parallel to the substrate surface. This imparts a one-dimensional order to these samples; while the z-axis for each membrane (collinear with the membrane normal) is roughly parallel to the substrate normal, the x-and y-axes remain disordered. Exploiting the plane-polarized nature of synchrotron radiation, spectra can be collected at different angles between the substrate normal and the X-ray E vector (Fig.Further refinement can be performed for samples with three-dimensional order. FigureAn example of polarized XANES spectra from a Mn(V) model complex is shown in Fig.

Range-Extended EXAFS:
In the typical EXAFS measurement of biological samples, spectra are taken up to ~500 eV above the K-absorption edge, that provides a k-range of ~12.0 /Å. However, longer the k-range, the EXAFS distance resolution improves and it becomes important for some systems to resolve distance heterogeneity with similar metal-ligand and metal-metal interactions. The distance resolution in a typical EXAFS experiment is given by ΔR ¼ π=2k max ð28:1Þwhere k max is the maximum energy of the photoelectron of the absorber element.Getting larger k max is not always possible, in particular, for systems which contain adjacent elements in the periodic table due to the presence of the rising edge of the next element. In principle, solid-state detectors can be used for discriminating fluorescence signals from different elements, by electronically windowing the Kα fluorescence from the absorber atom and collecting XAS data as an excitation spectrum. However, the energy resolution of the detector at the transition metal absorption edges is about 150-200 eV (fwhm), and this makes it difficult to discriminate signals from adjacent transition metals. For the Mn K-edge EXAFS studies of PS II, for example, the absorption edge of the obligatory Fe in PS II (2-3Fe/PS II) limits the EXAFS energy range (Fig.

X-Ray Emission Spectroscopy:
The sensitivity of the Kβ 1,3 /Kβ 0 spectra to the number of unpaired 3d electrons has the potential for being used for probing different metal sites in multinuclear clusters. As mentioned in Section II, there is no "silent" state in XAS. This can be a limiting factor for studying the system that contains several of the same element. For uniquely probing one particular reaction site, the use of different K-emission signals could become useful. One example is the [FeFe]-hydrogenases that contain 6 Fe in the metal catalytic center (H-cluster). Haumann et al. studied the H-cluster with site-selective XAS method, by using the Kβ 1,3 and Kβ 0 signals to distinguish between the low and high spin Fe sites in the two subcomplexes (Fig.The higher energy emission peaks above Kβ 1,3 originate from valence-to-core transitions just below the Fermi level and can be separated into Kβ 00 and the Kβ 2,5 emission (Fig.Detecting the chemical states of ligands is important for understanding the reaction mechanism of numerous metalloenzymes. In particular, protonation/ deprotonation states of ligands moderate reaction chemistry in metal centers in biologically important processes. For example, copper oxo/hydroxo/peroxo complexes play vital roles in respiration, such as in hemocyaninThe Kβ 2,5 and Kβ 00 XES was also applied for the study of nitrogenase to identify the central atom of the FeMoco cluster

Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering Spectroscopy:
The pre-edge region of metal K-edge XAS, that corresponds to the 1s to 3d transition, is a probe of metal oxidation state and local geometry of metal catalytic centers. However, the K pre-edge spectra are usually weak compared to the K-main edge, as they mostly arise from quadrupole transition matrix elements. In addition, it suffers from a strong background from the dipole-allowed transition of the main edge, particularly for early transition metals. Transition metal L-edge XAS are in some ways a superior chemical probe to K-edge spectra as (1) 2p ! 3d transitions are allowed under dipole selection rules, while only s ! p transitions are allowed at the K-edge, (2) greater sensitivity to the occupancy of the 3d orbitals of metal provides a better indication of the oxidation states and symmetry of the complex involved. It is therefore anticipated that examination of the L-edge region will provide oxidation state information of the metal centers with significantly better resolution than that from K-edges. However, the disadvantage is that the energy of these transitions requires the use of soft X-rays for direct excitation, leading to drastically increased radiation damage compared to high energy hard X-rays (100 times higher) and only surface absorption for bulk samples. These issues make soft X-ray (metal L-edge) spectroscopy less applicable to biological systems.The above-described problems can be overcome in 1s2p RIXS (resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy. In this method, hard X-rays tuned to the energy of the K pre-edge are used to excite a 1s electron into an unoccupied valence orbital (1s to 3d transition), and the emission due to decay of a 3p or 2p electron into the 1s shell is measured as a function of the excitation energy. In experiments, the incident energy is varied across the metal K-edge (1s to 3d) using hard X-rays, and the crystal analyzer is scanned over the Kα emission energy (2p to 1s). The energy difference between excitation and emission corresponds to the energy difference between 2p or 3p and 3d orbitals and, therefore, one can get L-edge-like XAS spectrum while taking advantage of using hard X-rays (high-excitation energy and therefore the high X-ray penetration depth and larger attenuation length) to probe these transitions indirectly. In addition, the RIXS 2D plot also makes the background separation of the pre-edge structure from the main K-edge feature easier.As an example, the Fe site of the cytochrome c (cyt c) and its model compound was studied by Fe 1s2d RIXS

Application of XFELs for the Study of Metalloenzymes Using X-Ray Spectroscopy:
X-ray based techniques, such as X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, as well as X-ray scattering methods, have contributed significantly to the structural and functional studies of metalloenzymes in the last decades, and have become indispensable methods. However, to minimize or eliminate radiation-induced changes during data collection has remained challenging. As described in Section II, the data collection of biological samples is usually carried out at cryogenic temperature to minimize the X-ray induced effect. However, there is an increasing effort to understand biological phenomena as the enzymes function, through studies under physiological/functional conditions. Additionally, the need to probe rare transitions, which often are superior probes of chemical states but require very high photon fluxes, , within a reasonable time, is another issue. The recent advent of XFELsThe hard X-ray XES method has a few advantages, when it is applied at the XFELs. No monochromatization is necessary and the full SASE (self-amplified spontaneous emission) bandwidth of the XFEL pulse can be used in the shot-byshot data collectionAmong the several X-ray spectroscopic methods, XES is well suited to be combined with other techniques. For example, XES can be collected simultaneously with X-ray crystallography by choosing the same excitation energy (Fig.

Future Direction:
X-ray spectroscopy, together with X-ray crystallography, has been an extremely important method for understanding the mechanism of metal catalytic reactions in metalloenzymes. The development of theoretical approaches, like density functional theory (DFT), with well-characterized model inorganic complexes has provided the necessary information for interpreting spectroscopic data. Furthermore, the recent development of bright synchrotron X-ray sources and the X-ray free electron laser further opens new horizons for data collection from biological samples under physiological conditions in a time-resolved manner. These developments altogether will provide tools for us to understand the mechanism of catalytic Fig.

Monometallic Selox Catalysts:
Quick and dispersive XAS have the capability to monitor dynamic changes in catalyst structure under reaction conditions ("operando" spectroscopy) and have been applied to alcohol selox over PdIt is interesting to note that in each of these studies the introduction of oxygen to the reactant feed improved alcohol conversion and aldehyde production, observations which the authors interpreted as due to hydrogen abstraction from the catalyst surface rather than a more plausible change in palladium oxidation state. In contrast to their liquid phase experiments, high pressure X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements on Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalysed benzyl alcohol selox in supercritical CO 2 led Grunwaldt and Baiker to conclude that maximum activity arose from particles mainly oxidised in the surface/shelf-edgeThe nature of the active phase in alcohol selox catalysed by palladium nanoparticles was conclusively established through subsequent multi-dimensional spectroscopic investigations of vapour phase crotyl alcohol seloxSupported monomeric Pd complexes have also shown great promise in selox, wherein XAS has proven crucial in elucidating the active species. Mori et al. employed ex situ Pd K-edge XAS to demonstrate that hydroxyapatites treated with PdCl 2 (PhCN) 2 afforded two types of immobilised complex with distinct coordination spheres dependent upon the Ca/P ratio of the parent hydroxyapatite (Fig.

Selective Hydrogenation:
Catalytic hydrogenation of organic compounds possessing multiple unsaturated bonds such as α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is particularly challengingBiomass derived chemicals are of great current academic and industrial interest due to their potential in sustainable manufacturing5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is another important biomass platform chemical, whose hydrogenation to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) is an attractive route to high Fig.Partial hydrogenation of alkynes is an essential step in the petrochemical processing of alkenes for the polymer industry, in which traces of co-produced alkynes which are poisonous to downstream polymerisation catalysts must be removed via front-and/or tail-end catalytic partial hydrogenation to additional alkene

Conclusions:
X-ray absorption spectroscopy has proved an invaluable tool for catalytic scientists over many decades in characterising the structure and electronic properties of heterogeneous (and homogeneous) catalyst components. Recent advances in the design of synchrotron optics, high sensitivity and dispersive detectors, and innovative reactor cells permitting for example flow operation, multi-phase reactions and coupling to additional analytical tools for multi-dimensional experiments, in conjunction with wider access to high energy synchrotron radiation sources, now provide opportunities for investigating the nature of active species and mechanistic pathways of working catalysts for diverse green chemical transformations. However, a number of challenges remain. Further improvements in the spatial resolution of XAS methods are necessary to permit more detailed mapping of the distribution of catalyst components across packed beds in flow reactors (micron-scale) and individual catalyst particles (1-100 nm scale); this is essential in order to better discriminate and quantify leaching of active metal components and synergies between different bimetal and/or support functions in multifunctional catalysts respectively. A shorter time resolution for spectral acquisition (1 ns-1 ms) will also help to discriminate the relative roles of spectator and active catalyst species, and identify short-lived reactive intermediates, thus providing hitherto unparalleled insight into catalyst transition states and factors influencing competing reaction pathways. Both these goals will only be possible through complementary enhancements in detector sensitivity, permitting the identification and quantification of all catalyst components at all stages of the individual catalytic cycle and overall process operation (down to ppb-ppm concentration) in order to correlate structural and kinetics measurements. In summary, XAS has to date helped shed invaluable insight into the nature of the catalytically active species participating in oxidation, hydrogenation and coupling reactions which underpin the valorisation of petrochemical and renewable chemical feedstocks, to elucidate key deactivation pathways, and to help optimise the formulation of bimetallic catalysts and reactor operating conditions.

Introduction:
It is well known that gasoline engines emit several pollutants as the result of fuel combustion, including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and hydrocarbons (HC). These harmful gases were recognized as a serious problem for the environments beginning in the 1960s, and various laws obligating automobile manufacturers to drastically reduce pollutants in exhaust, including the Muskie Act in the United States, were enacted in many countries in the 1970s. In order to solve this problem, three-way catalysts capable of converting toxic gases into harmless compounds were put into practical use in 1977, and these systems are now employed in almost all gasoline engine vehicles. In such compounds, a monolithic honeycomb is coated with a powdered catalyst, which typically consists of precious metal particles such as platinum (Pt), rhodium (Rh), and palladium (Pd) dispersed on a metal oxide support.To allow the practical application of three-way catalysts, it is important to maintain the air to fuel (A/F) ratio in the engine inlet gas within an ideal range, and this can be accomplished by advanced electronics and oxygen sensors. It is also vital to disperse the precious metals on the support as infinitesimal particles to achieve high catalytic performance. Analysis of the dispersion state of precious metals and measurements of particle sizes may be performed via electron microscopy, while elemental identification is accomplished by X-ray diffraction and chemical states are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis of catalysts has become increasingly common as K. Dohmae (*) Materials Analysis & Evaluation Dept., Toyota Central R&D Labs. Inc., 480-1192 Japan e-mail: kdohmae@mosk.tytlabs.co.jp the use of synchrotron radiation has been more widely adopted. In recent years, XAFS has become an indispensable technique in catalyst analysis because of its ability to determine both the local structure and the chemical state of each element and to readily perform in situ analyses.

EXAFS Analysis of the Local Structure of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 Oxide:
Automotive three-way catalysts are able to eliminate CO, NOx, and HC from exhaust gases only under stoichiometric conditions, meaning that the A/F ratio of the gases being introduced to the engine must be approximately 14.6. Because it is difficult to accurately supply the correct amount of fuel to maintain an ideal A/F ratio, in practice the composition of the inlet gases actually fluctuates around the stoichiometric ratio. In such cases, the catalyst often does not function efficiently, depending only on the catalytic activity of the noble metals employed. For this reason, three-way catalysts contain a promoter having a suitable oxygen storage/ release capacity (OSC) in order to maintain stoichiometric conditions in the vicinity of the catalyst. Ceria-based oxides are widely used as promoters due to the high OSC efficiency of these materials based on the reversible redox reaction CeO 2 $ CeO 2-x þ (x/2)O 2 (x ¼ 0 to 0.5). It has been demonstrated that the addition of ZrO 2 to CeO 2 enhances the OSC of the promoter and also improves its thermal stabilityIn their study, Ce K-edge (40.5 keV) extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) has been applied to the analysis of the cation-cation (cation ¼ Ce, Zr) network as well as the oxygen environment in CeO 2 -ZrO 2 . In the past, Ce L 3 -edge (5.7 keV) EXAFS was utilized for CeO 2 -ZrO 2 analysisThree types of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 compounds having the same composition but different OSC efficiencies (Ce/Zr ¼ 1; CZ55-1, CZ55-2, and CZ55-3) were prepared for this study. CZ55-1 was synthesized by precipitation with aqueous NH 3 using CeO 2 powder and an aqueous ZrO(NO 3 ) 2 solution followed by calcination in air at 500 C for 3 h. CZ55-2 was prepared by co-precipitation with aqueous NH 3 using aqueous solutions of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 and ZrO(NO 3 ) 2 and subsequent calcination in air at 500 C for 3 h. CZ55-3 was obtained using the same co-precipitation process as applied to CZ55-2, except that the dried powder was reduced at 1200 C for 4 h in CO and further oxidized in air at 500 C for 3 h. The OSC properties of these materials are summarized in TableFourier transforms (FTs) of the 3-17 Å À1 regions of the Ce K-edge EXAFS spectra are presented in Fig.Figure

XAFS Analysis of Interactions Between Supported Platinum and Support Oxides:
In three-way catalysts, precious metals such as Pt, Pd and Rh are highly dispersed on the support oxides as small particles only several nanometers in diameter.Exposing the catalyst to high temperatures (~800 C and above) agglomerates and sinters the precious metals, decreasing their active surface area.The findings of this study indicate that the Pt supported on CZY interacts with the Ce in the same support and forms Pt-O-Ce bonds at high temperatures under an oxidizing atmosphere, resulting in less sintering of the Pt particles. Since the Pt supported on Al 2 O 3 does not undergo sufficient interaction to form Pt-support bonds and is able to diffuse on the support, it undergoes aggregation into Pt particles.

Operando XAFS Analysis of the Pt/Al 2 O 3 Catalyst:
The operando spectroscopic method was recently introduced in catalysis researchIn order to perform operando XAFS analysis, both in situ XAFS instrumentation and a system to evaluate catalytic activity are required. FigureIn region I, the fraction of metallic Pt increases, although no C 3 H 6 conversion is observed. This suggests a self-poisoning effect during the C 3 H 6 -O 2 reaction over the Pt surface, through preferential adsorption of C 3 H 6 instead of O 2 on the Pt surfaces. Although the adsorbed C 3 H 6 is expected to reduce the oxidized Pt, no catalytic reaction is observed because the temperature is not high enough to break the C-C bonds of the adsorbed C 3 H 6 . In region II, some conversion of C 3 H 6 is observed and the conversion rate increases as the temperature is increased. The reaction in this region is believed to be controlled by the number of the active sites, because the conversion of C 3 H 6 is below 30 %. The surface area covered by metallic Pt therefore appears to be associated with the extent of the catalytic reaction. In region III, the metallic Pt fraction decreases with increasing temperature. In contrast, the conversion of C 3 H 6 steadily increases to over 30 % in this region, and hence, the area covered by metallic Pt evidently does not completely correlate with the progression of the catalytic reaction. Therefore, the presence of a certain amount of the metallic Pt appears to promote the catalytic reaction, although there are apparently other factors involved. The loss of metallic Pt in region III is believed to occur through oxidation by residual oxygen following the conversion reaction, as shown in Fig.The operando analysis in this work allowed assessments of the oxidation state of Pt in the catalyst and its effect on the activation process. These studies demonstrated that the early stage of the catalytic activation consists of a combination of the creation of active sites and a catalytic reaction over these sites. This result indicates that the formation of metallic Pt sites and the activation of adsorbed species on Pt are both important to the progression of the catalytic reaction at low temperatures. More generally, this project has also shown that operando spectroscopy is a very useful technique for understanding the behavior of automotive catalysts.

Introduction:
The structural study at solid-liquid interfaces, i.e., electrode-electrolyte interfaces, is one of the key targets not only of fundamental surface science but also of various applied sciences such as fuel cells, sensors, and batteries, because many important processes, such as adsorption/desorption, solvation/desolvation, and the electrode reaction itself, take place at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces. It is essential to clarify the electronic and geometric structures at these interfaces with atomic dimensions, in situ, and in real timeOptical spectroscopies using ultraviolet, visible, and infrared lights have a high time resolution, but not a high enough spatial resolution.The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) technique, as documented in the previous chapters, provides a lot of information about both the three-dimensional geometric and electronic structures at electrode-electrolyte interfaces with atomic dimensions, both in situ and in real timeMoreover, XAFS has the following few advantages over SPM and SXS: (1) XAFS is applicable not only to single crystal flat surfaces but also to polycrystalline surfaces and nanoparticles because it is unnecessary for this technique to use the sample with a long range order, (2) XAFS can analyze not only the local geometric structure, but also the electronic structure of the target atom, and (3) XAFS can selectively detect the signal from the target atom. Therefore, it has been utilized for a variety of electrode-electrolyte interfaces such as single-/polycrystal surfaces, thin films, and nanoparticles.During the early stage, research studies of the electrode-electrolyte interfaces using the in situ XAFS technique focused on the adsorbed species on the electrode surface

Experimental Methodology:
Since XAFS is not inherently surface sensitive due to the relatively long penetration depth of the X-rays, the obtained signal is often buried within information from the bulk, which is not involved in the electrochemical reactions. Thus, various in situ electrochemical cells have been developed to selectively extract the signal from the target atom at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces. The typical configuration of the electrochemical cell for the in situ XAFS measurements in the transmission mode, as shown in Fig.As compared to the transmission mode, on the other hand, the fluorescence mode is more useful for in situ studies at electrode-electrolyte interfaces in the following cases: (1) the quantity of the target material is too small to detect the difference between the incident and transmitted X-ray intensities, and/or (2) the thickness of the sample is too thick for X-rays to transmit. Electrochemical cells in the thin layer configurationThis configuration can be used for the total reflection fluorescence mode, which enables the surface sensitive analysis, typically at a depth of several nm. Furthermore, since EXAFS oscillations are sensitive to the angle between the bond direction and polarization vector of the incident X-ray, polarization-dependent measurements can be performed by employing this configuration. A disadvantage of this thin-layer configuration is, however, suppression of the effective mass transfer due to the thin electrolyte layer. In order to obtain an effective mass transfer, the backside illumination fluorescence configuration was proposed

Metal Deposition on Single Crystalline Metal and Semiconductor Electrodes:
Since deposition of a metal monolayer and submonolayer on a foreign metal substrate can strongly modify the reactivity and electrocatalytic activity, welldefined metal layers deposited on single crystal electrode surfaces, such as an underpotentially deposited (UPD) metal monolayer, have been investigated by various in situ techniques including SPM, SXS, and XAFS. There is an advantage of in situ XAFS over SPM and SXS for investigating electrochemically deposited metal layers; in situ XAFS can selectively probe not only the local structure, but also the oxidation state of the target atoms. Cu UPD is one of the most studied systems because Cu K-edge spectra of various Cu-based compounds are available as references. In addition, the atomic arrangement of electrodeposited Cu layers have been determined by SPMThe effect of the coadsorption of a chloride anion on the structure of the Cu UPD layer on AuThere were also many reports about the in situ XAFS analysis of electrodeposited Cu on the Pt(111) system. The effect of the halide ions on the adsorbed structure of Cu was studied by Abruña et al.In addition to Cu on AuStructure analyzes of the electrodeposited metal layer on a semiconductor electrode were also reported. We investigated the local structures of electrodeposited Cu on p-GaAs(100) with various coverages by in situ XAFS

Metal Deposition on Polycrystalline Electrode and Nanoparticle Surfaces:
Because XAFS can analyze the local structure not only of the single crystal electrode but also of the polycrystal, there were several structural studies of electrodeposited metal layers on polycrystal electrode and nanoparticle surfaces.McBreen and coworkers investigated the geometric and electronic structures of electrodeposited CuIn order to clarify the origin of the difference in the electrocatalytic activities for the methanol oxidation between the UPD Sn on the carbon-supported Pt and carbon-supported SnPt alloy, in situ XAFS measurements were carried out by McBreen and MukerjeeIn order to study the effect of Ru modification on the carbon monoxide tolerance to the Pt catalyst for the PEMFCs, the geometric and electronic structures of Ru-modified carbon-supported Pt were investigated by in situ XAFSPelliccione et al. structurally and electronically studied Pt nanoparticles with and without electrodeposited Ru layersStructural studies of the electrodeposited Cu layers on the iodine-treated carbonsupported Pt surface

Electrocatalytic Reactions:
Key processes in energy conversion devices, such as fuel cells, rechargeable batteries, and photocatalysts, are usually very complicated, involving multiple reactions of electrons, protons, and solution species, and then the reaction activity, selectivity, and durability are strongly affected by the geometric and electronic structures of the active materials on the electrodes. Since XAFS can analyze both the geometric and electronic structures, as already mentioned, in situ XAFS has been applied for clarifications of the mechanism of multi-electron and proton transfer reactions associated with the development of energy conversion devices.PEMFCs have attracted much attention because of their high theoretical efficiencyOne of the effective approaches to improve the ORR activity and reduce the loading amount of Pt, which is a precious and high cost material, is utilization of co-catalysts in combination with Pt, and a variety of transition metalsFigureThe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has attracted much attention regarding the relation with artificial photosynthesis. Recently, we constructed organic molecular layers, which consist of viologen moieties as an electron transfer mediator and Pt complexes as a multi-electron transfer catalyst, on the hydrogen-terminated Si2À ions, we originally considered that the Pt complexes incorporated within the molecular layer were reduced to Pt metal nanoparticles and the actual catalyst for HER was the Pt metal nanoparticle. However, the formation of such nanoparticles was not observed by SEM, and the peak positions of the Pt 4f peaks in the XP spectrum of the Pt-V 2þ -Si(111) surface after the HER was at a binding energy slightly higher than that of Pt in the metallic state. Thus, an in situ polarization-dependent total-reflection fluorescence (PTRF)-XAFS analysis of the Pt-V 2þ -Si2À in the molecular layer in air. As the potential was made more negative, the shoulder gradually decreased and finally disappeared at À0.6 V. The EXAFS oscillation in the region of k between 8 and 12 was significantly changed due to the replacement of Cl À with oxygenated species such as water or hydroxyl groups, which was supported by a FEFF simulation. Thus, Pt complexes act as molecular catalysts confined within the organic molecular layers without being converted into metal nanoparticles. Since noble metals are generally very extensive and limited resources, the atom efficiency needs to be a maximum as long as their practical uses are concerned. Such single atomic and molecular catalysts which enable a 100 % atom efficiency are a promising concept.

Introduction:
The surface structure of supported metal clusters can be finely controlled by using a well-defined metal complex and surface modifications, as described in the other chapter. The surface structures are stabilized by the interaction between the metal and support oxide. Investigation of a metal species on a single-crystal oxide surface will provide further knowledge regarding the structure of the metal species on oxide surfaces and the metal-oxide interaction. However, the investigation of a metal species on a single-crystal oxide surface is not easy because of the small amount of metal species and high penetration ability of the X-ray. As described in the other chapter, polarization-dependent total reflection fluorescence XAFS (PTRF-XAFS) will provide three-dimensional structural information of a metal species highly dispersed on flat surfaces. In this chapter, we discuss how to obtain an atomically dispersed metal species by controlling the oxide surface property and structure (mainly a TiO 2

Metals in Domain III:
Molybdenum is located in Domain III as it has a strong interaction with the oxide surface. Actually, Mo is often observed not in the metallic state but in the hexavalent state (Mo 6þ ), when PTRF-XAFS is applied to the Mo system on the TiO 2There are two types of Ti. One is exposed Ti, known as fivefold Ti, while the other Ti is covered with bridging oxygen atoms, known as sixfold Ti

Metals in Domain II:
Ni is located on the border of Domains I and II. Therefore, the Ni structures vary depending on the preparation conditions. A two-dimensional dispersion has been observed when the Ni was deposited on the TiO 2It is often assumed that the Ni-Ti interaction on the TiO 2

Precious Metals in Domain I and Their Atomic Distributions:
Additional precious metals in Domain I, such as Au and Cu, which have more metalmetal interactions than metal-oxygen interactions, are easily aggregated on the oxide surface. FigureAn organometallic compound was used as a highly dispersed metal species on an oxide surface. When Cu(DPM) 2 (DPM ¼ dipivaloylmethanate, 2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-3,5-heptadione) was reacted with the TiO 2The other method to disperse the metal species is an anchoring method using a compound that has two binding sites: the metal binding site and oxide surface binding site. The TiO 2FigureCu could be dispersed on the MBA-modified TiO 2In the case of Cu, thiophene carboxylic acid (TCA) also dispersed Cu atomically, making a sandwich structure between the S of TCA and surface oxygen atoms with bond distances of 2.19 Å and 1.89 Å, respectivelyWhen the TiO 2One acetate (A) adsorbed on the TiO 2 surface in a bidentate structure and the other acetate (B) was bound to the bridging oxygen of TiO 2

Summary:
Total reflection fluorescence XAFS is a unique method that reveals atomically dispersed metal on a single crystal or flat surface. Basically, dispersion of the metal is determined by the strength of the metal-anion interaction. Control of the metal-anion interaction enables us to control the fine structure of the metal species on the surface.
