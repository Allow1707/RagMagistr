INTRODUCTION:
X-Rays are absorbed by matter and the intensity is attenuated. The degree of absorption (absorbance) depends on the wavelength of the X-rays as well as the thickness, density, atomic number, and the local structure of the absorber. FigureThe interaction between X-rays and matter is classified into absorption, elastic scattering, and inelastic scattering. The basic physical formula of X-ray absorption are described elsewhere.X-Ray absorption spectroscopy is referred to as XANES (X-ray absorption near edge structure) and EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) (FigureReproduced by permission of Electrotechnical Laboratory radial distribution function of the X-ray absorbing atom. The XANES spectra represent the electronic structure of the conduction band. XAFS (X-ray absorption fine structure) is the generic name for XANES and EXAFS. XAS (X-ray absorption spectroscopy) is less used than XAFS, but has a similar meaning.

BASICS FOR XAFS:
XAFS has a long history since de Broglie and a summary is given by Lytle.11 The 10th International Conference on XAFS was held in Chicago in 1998, 12 the 11th at Ako, Japan in 2000, 13 and the 12th at Malmö, Sweden in 2003 (near to the Swedish synchrotron radiation facility MAX lab). 14 Other earlier international conferences and their proceedings are listed elsewhere.

EXTREME CONDITIONS:
The measurement of XAFS is now a routine experiment for local structure or electronic structure characterizations. Therefore techniques to measure the XAFS spectra under extreme conditions, such as high pressure and/or high temperature, have been developed.With a combination of an atomic absorption spectrometer and XAFS spectrometer, Nakai et al.

COMBINATION WITH SCANNING TUNNELING MICROSCOPES:
When the X-rays are absorbed, secondary quanta will be created by the energetic X-ray photons. Probing these secondary quanta using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) or scanning capacitance microscope, 33 -38 high spatial resolution microscopes will be realized in the near future, though the present spatial resolution is only 1 mm or less. 4 3 2 1 0 4 5 3 2 1 0 Intensity (arb. units) v (n 1 ) = 0 1 v (n 1 ) = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 4 H 2 O D 2 O n 2 n 2 534 536 Photon energy (eV) 538 540 0 1 2 3 4 Intensity (arb. units) 4a 1 2b 2 3pa 1 /3pb 1 4pa 1 /4pb 1 (a) (b) (c)

COMBINATION WITH OPTICAL LUMINESCENCE:
When X-rays are absorbed, visible light is emitted from the sample. This is called the X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL). Its intensity depends on the absorbance, but does not directly depend on it, because of very complicated relaxation processes. 4 Its wavelength depends on the analyte. Figure 5.8.8 shows a decay spectrum of Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Ce measured with single bunch synchrotron radiation as an input, 39 which was regarded as a delta function in the time domain.When a narrow time window is selected in the decay line shape, for recording the XAFS spectra, some optical relaxation process corresponding to the time delay can be probed, because some optical processes are delayed depending on its transition probability, or in other words, lifetime of an excited state. When a narrow wavelength window is selected in the optical luminescence spectra, a chemical species can be probed. By selecting these time and wavelength windows at the same time, a novel characterization method will be realized. Porous materials, 40 nanoparticles 41 and optically active materials 42 are suitable targets for the XEOL method. The line shape measured by the luminescence yield is usually broader than those of the total electron yield XAFS spectra.

COMBINATION WITH X-RAY FLUORESCENCE:
When the stronger incident X-rays are absorbed, the stronger X-ray fluorescence is emitted. Therefore the X-ray fluorescence intensity is a measure of absorbance. This type of measurement is called the X-ray fluorescence yield (XFY) method. The XFY method has been used with an X-ray detector such as a photodiode or a proportional counter without wavelength selection. The X-ray detector is placed close to the sample and the total X-ray fluorescence intensity is measured. Jaklevic et al.Muramatsu et al.total XFY, Ni Lα and Lβ partial X-ray fluorescence yields, the difference of these two, and the total electron yield (TEY). 46 X-Ray fluorescence spectra show chemical shift due to the difference in effective charges. Therefore the XAFS spectra yielded by the chemical-shifted X-ray fluorescence peaks can be obtained. Izumi et al.

PHOTOCONDUCTIVE AND ELECTROCHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS:
The electrical conductance of a solid changes with the change of the wavelength of the incident X-rays. This is because the valence electrons are excited into the conduction band and thus the density of conduction electrons changes, or, an atom, whose core electron is photoionized, behaves as an impurity in the metal. The response of conductance is thus sometimes positive and sometimes negative.Many kinds of electrochemical cell or in situ cell for EXAFS measurements were proposed and are summarized by Sharpe et al.

TOTAL REFLECTION XAFS:
Heald et al.The X-rays emitted from a bending magnet of a synchrotron light source is polarized in such a way that the electric vector is parallel to the horizontal plane. Thus the electric dipole moment in this plane in a sample can be easily excited and thus the X-rays are strongly absorbed when a column of atoms is present in this direction. Figure

ELECTRON AND OTHER SECONDARY YIELD METHODS AND THEIR SURFACE SENSITIVITY:
When X-rays are impinging on a surface and absorbed, then photoelectrons, consequently Auger electrons or X-ray fluorescence, and secondary electrons are emitted. These electrons are generated both in deep places where the incident X-rays reach, as well as in the shallow surface region. Therefore the detection of these electrons, or alternatively the measurement of the sample electric current (this method is called the TEY method), was thought to be bulk sensitive. Recently it has however been clarified that the electrons emitted from the sample surface, or the sample electric current, are both surface sensitive. This evidence has been independently found by several researchers.

STRONG FIELD EFFECTS:
XAFS are measured for a sample with the application of a strong field, such as laser light or a magnetic field. With a combination of an external field, we can obtain a new chemical information on the sample.

This is also achieved by a phase retarder, such as a λ/4 wavelength slab. The absorption coefficient is slightly different for these two polarizations of the incident X-rays. The transmitted X-ray intensity as well as the X-ray fluorescence intensity show the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD).

Taken from Nakamura et al. 98XMCD and clarified the interaction between the magnetization film and CO unoccupied orbital π * , which had orbital magnetic moments.The XMCD experiment will be useful, when combined with the grazing incident technique, for the characterization of thin multilayer films made by changing the parameters (temperature, pressure, concentration, etc.) in a processing method. 5.8.11 MICROSCOPY Microscopy and imaging of various samples using the X-ray absorption techniques are summarized in Figure 5.8.22; 105 the techniques used are the microbeam scanning technique (the sample is moved in the real experiment) and tomography technique. Transmission-type microimaging without an X-ray optical lens has been widely used. Microscopes using a soft X-ray lens (Figure 5.8.23 106 ) have also been extensively used. 107,108 The scanning microbeam method is usually combined with µ-X-ray diffraction 109 -112 or X-ray fluorescence 113,114 beamlines in a synchrotron radiation facility.The principle of X-ray microtomography is shown in Figure

EELS, ELNES AND EXELFS:
Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is a technique used in transmission electron microscopy (TEM), where electrons transmit through a thin film and energy absorbed by the thin film during transmission is measured by an electron energy analyser. EELS is classified into energy loss near edge structure (ELNES) and extended energy loss fine structure (EXELFS). This classification is similar to XANES and EXAFS. When the electron energy is measured in the forward direction, the  selection rule of an electron transition in an atom is similar to that of an optical (X-ray) transition, i.e. the electric dipole selection rule. Thus the resulting EELS spectra can be interpreted in the same way as the X-ray absorption spectra.

EXEFS:
Very weak fine structures are always found at the low energy side of strong characteristic X-ray fluorescence or X-ray emission lines. The intensity is usually less than 1 % of the Kα main line. These fine structures are called the 'radiative Auger satellites'.Recently a wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer was equipped with an EXEFS analysis computer program as shown in Figure

DAFS:
Diffraction anomalous fine structure (DAFS) is an alternative method to measure the XAFS spectra proposed by Stragier et al.

THEORY AND INTERPRETATION OF XAFS SPECTRA:
Though the contribution from many electron excitations in XAFS spectra was suggested more than 20 years ago, 147 this effect was not seriously considered until recently. These multiple-excitation phenomena were studied by Ito et al.'Atomic XAFS' has been said to exist in XAFS spectra. It is another origin of a step-like structure in EXAFS spectra. Usually EXAFS oscillation is due to the condensed matter effect; the outgoing photoelectron wave interferes with the backscattered waves by its neighboring atoms. Therefore, the EXAFS signal is not observable for an isolated single atom. However, the shape of the potential of a single atom itself has the effect to backscatter the electron wave and some kind of interference pattern with longer period than the EXAFS oscillation is observable. The structures observed in an isolated single atom EXAFS are interpreted both from the view point of double-electron excitation and from atomic XAFS; the existence of 'atomic XAFS' is still controversial.Another class of computation code is the molecular orbital (MO) method expressed by a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAOs). The discrete variational Xα (DV-Xα) method is most convenient in the LCAO-MO method, while the multiple scattering Xα (MS-Xα) method is the basis of the FEFF and other multiple scattering methods. The DV-Xα method can calculate the core-hole relaxation state easily. This is the reason why the DV-Xα method is extensively used. The LCAO-MO method including the DV-Xα method is only applicable to XANES (below 50 eV above the absorption edge) spectra, though the multiple scattering methods are applicable to both XANES and EXAFS spectra. Jiang and Ellis 155 calculated the XANES spectra of various Co compounds using the DV-Xα method. The molecule SF 6 has been a reference material for more than 30 years 156,157 in experiments as well as a check for a computer code.The core-hole effect is an important factor to interpret mixed valence compounds. According to the calculation of Suzuki et al.,The pre-edge structure is a good index of the chemical environment of the X-ray absorbing atom. It is strong for tetragonally coordinated transition metals, but weak for octahedrally coordinated transition metals. The pre-edge structure is sometimes assigned to the 1s-3d electric quadrupole transition, but the relation to Kβ

STANDARDIZATION:

Taguchi and White 174 proposed the use of a crystal structure database to simplify the modeling problem in EXAFS analysis. A rapid calculation method using parallel computation has been proposed.Using a numerical method, a diffraction-free EXAFS spectrum (Figure

Reproduced by permission of Electrotechnical Laboratory filters are used to select the X-ray wavelengths, they are used in a variety of industries.On the other hand, X-ray absorption spectrometers are used in both laboratories and synchrotron facilities for basic science, such as surface science, 192,193 cluster chemistry 194 and electron correlation in transition metal oxides.One of the shortcomings of X-ray absorption spectroscopy was that absorption spectra of all the elements were not measurable using one beamline. This shortcoming has been overcome in many beamlines at many synchrotron facilities and X-ray absorption spectroscopy has become a powerful tool for the analysis of practical samples.
