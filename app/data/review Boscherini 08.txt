**Abstract**  
X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) is a powerful tool in the study of the local atomic environment in condensed matter. It has been often applied to the study of semiconductor heterostructures and nanostructures, significantly contributing to their characterization at the local level and to the understanding of the relation between atomic structure and physical properties.

This chapter begins with an introduction to XAFS as a tool for the determination of local structure; the physical origin of the fine structure is illustrated and the present understanding of X-ray absorption spectra in the framework of multiple scattering theory is outlined. The second section contains a description of the diverse experimental setups and detection schemes, which can be used in the field of semiconductor science; an effort has been made to make this section both as complete and up-to-date as possible, so that it can serve as a useful reference, also outside the field of semiconductor physics. In the third section, a review of the use of XAFS to study semiconductor heterostructures and nanostructures is presented, covering bond length variations in strained heterostructures, local atomic environments in nanostructures (Ge islands, embedded nanoparticles, porous Si, and related systems), nitride heterostructures, and thin films, and finally dilute alloys heterostructures, that is dilute nitrides and dilute magnetic semiconductors.

## 1. Introduction to X-ray absorption spectroscopy for local structural studies
In this section an introduction to X-ray absorption fine structure is reported. After a review of some basic phenomenology, the origin of the fine structure in X-ray absorption spectra is described. An outline of multiple scattering (MS) theory is presented and, in this framework, the extended and near-edge regions of the X-ray absorption spectrum are discussed.

### 1.1. Outline and origin of the fine structure in X-ray absorption spectra
In the X-ray and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectral regions, photoelectric absorption is the dominant interaction mechanism between electromagnetic radiation and matter. An X-ray absorption spectrum is a measurement of the absorption coefficient of a sample, μ(hν), or of a quantity to which it is directly proportional, as a function of the energy of the impinging photons hν. One can determine (conceptually and experimentally) the absorption coefficient by measuring the flux of monochromatic photons incident on and transmitted by a sample of thickness x, I₀ and I_T, respectively; these quantities are related by μ(hν)x = −ln[I_T(hν)/I₀(hν)] via the relation I_T(hν) = I₀(hν) e^(−μ(hν)x) (1). The product μ(hν)x (a quantity proportional to the absorbance commonly used in VUV and visible spectroscopy) can be obtained by inverting this expression. 

The overall absorption coefficient of a sample is related to the atomic concentrations c_i and absorption cross sections σ_i(hν) of the constituent atoms by μ(hν) = Σ_i c_i σ_i(hν) (2). 

X-ray absorption spectra exhibit sharp absorption edges which occur at the energies at which excitation of particular core levels becomes energetically allowed. The energies of absorption edges are characteristic of each element; for example, excitation of electrons from 1s, 2s, 2p₁/₂, and 2p₃/₂ states correspond to the K, L_I, L_II, and L_III absorption edges, respectively.

The presence of fine structure in X-ray absorption spectra has been known since 1920; this fine structure shows up as a modulation of μ(hν) at energies greater than the absorption edge, the relative magnitude of which can be as high as ~10% and decays with increasing energy from the edge itself. Until the 1970s the field was plagued by contradictory experimental data and uncertain physical interpretation. Two decisive factors subsequently contributed to asserting XAFS as a valuable structural tool: the availability of brilliant and broadband synchrotron radiation sources and the development of an approximate but simple and useful point-scattering theory. The “modern” era of XAFS is usually traced to the paper by Sayers et al. Some historical reviews have been published recently and the interested reader is referred to them for details on the evolution of the technique; the introductory paragraph of the paper by Filipponi contains a compact historical summary.

The physical origin of XAFS in the framework of scattering theory can be understood quite easily. Consider an atom bound in a molecule or solid. In the one-electron approximation, the core level photoelectric absorption process is described in terms of the initial state consisting of the impinging photon of energy hν plus the electron in the core atomic orbital characterized by a wavefunction ψ_i with a binding energy E_B and a final state consisting of a core hole plus an excited electron characterized by a wavefunction ψ_f with an energy E_f. Depending on the photon energy, the electron can be excited to a discrete and bound final state or to a continuum state, and the interaction of this outgoing electron wave with the surrounding atoms gives rise to the oscillatory fine structure observed in XAFS.# Continuum and Unbound Final State

The final energy of the photoelectron is dictated by energy conservation,  
Eₓᶠ = ħω − E_B (3)

In the dipole approximation, the atomic absorption cross section (as for electronic transitions in the optical and UV region) is proportional to the square modulus of the matrix element of the position operator between the initial and final states:  
σ(ħω) ∝ |⟨cᵢ | ε̂·r | c_f⟩|² (4)  
where ε̂ is the unit vector defining the direction of the electric field of the exciting X-ray beam and r is the position operator.

Let us consider only continuum final states. If the atom were not embedded in a matrix (e.g., a monoatomic gas), the final‐state wave function at sufficiently high energies would be that of an outgoing spherical wave and no fine structure would result. The relation between wave number (k = 2π/λ, with λ the wavelength) and kinetic energy for such a free electron is  
k = √(2mEₓᶠ)/ħ = √[2m(ħω − E_B)]/ħ (5)

If the atom is bound in a molecule or solid, the photoelectron wave function is modified by the surrounding atoms’ potential; one describes this modification as due to the scattering (one or more times) of the photoelectron by the neighbors. The final‐state wave function becomes the outgoing spherical wave plus the scattered waves. Depending on the photoelectron wave number and on the relative atomic arrangement, the scattering process may enhance or diminish the amplitude of the final‐state wave function near the core‐level orbital and thus increase or decrease the cross section given by Eq. (4). This is an interference effect between the outgoing and scattered wave functions: the scattered field is the electron wave function while the scattering “objects” are the neighboring atoms. As in any interference phenomenon, the positions of maxima and minima in reciprocal space depend on the wavelength of the scattered field and on the geometry of the scattering object (e.g., slits, grating, or atomic lattice).

In the present case, for a given atomic structure, as the wave number depends on the photon energy via Eq. (5), the cross section varies with photon energy, exhibiting characteristic oscillations that are quasi-periodic in k. The structural sensitivity stems from the dependence on the relative positions between the absorbing (“central”) atom and the scattering (neighboring) atoms. A typical XAFS spectrum of crystalline GaAs at the Ga edge shows these fine‐structure modulations.

At high photoelectron energy, scattering by neighboring atoms’ potentials is weak; usually single‐scattering (SS) processes dominate. This is the **extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)** region. One defines the EXAFS function χ(k) as  
χ(k) = [μ(k) − μ₀(k)] / μ₀(k) (6)  
where μ₀(k) is the absorption coefficient in the absence of neighboring atoms.

As the photoelectron energy decreases toward the edge, multiple‐scattering (MS) processes become increasingly important. This spectral region—extending from the edge to roughly 50 eV above it—is commonly referred to as **X-ray absorption near‐edge structure (XANES)**.## 1.2 Multiple scattering theory framework and key approximations

In this section the basis of XAFS in the framework of multiple‐scattering (MS) theory is briefly outlined, with the objective of providing a guide for the reader.

Photoelectric absorption is treated in time‐dependent perturbation theory to first order in the perturbation A·p (the scalar product of the vector potential of the radiation field and the electron momentum operator). Application of Fermi’s golden rule gives the transition rate between discrete initial and final many‐electron states, C_i and C_f, respectively, as  
Wi→f = (2π/ħ) ∑_f |⟨C_i| ∑_j (e/m) A·p_j |C_f⟩|² δ(E_f − E_i − ħω) (7)  
where the index j covers all the electrons in the system and the label f identifies all final states compatible with the energy conservation dictated by the Dirac delta function. This intractable problem is greatly simplified in the one‐electron approximation, in which it is assumed that only one electron is involved in the process, the others being unaffected; many‐body corrections are added a posteriori. In this approximation, one electron makes a transition between a localized core atomic orbital (e.g., the 1s orbital), described by a wave function c_c, and a final state described by a wave function c_f; in ab initio calculations, the presence of the core hole can be taken into account in the calculation of c_f. A further common simplification is the dipole approximation, which neglects the spatial variation of the vector potential across the extent of the core‐level orbital. The photoelectric absorption cross section for transitions to continuum final states can be written in these approximations as  
σ(ħω) = 4π² α ħω |⟨c_c|ε̂·r|c_f⟩|² ρ(E_f) (8)  
where ρ(E_f) is the density of final states (E_f = E_c + ħω), and (in SI units) α = e²/(4πε₀ħc) ≃ 1/137 is the fine‐structure constant, which determines the order of magnitude of the cross section.

Important consequences of the dipole approximation are the selection rules which determine, on the basis of symmetry, which final states are allowed for a given initial state; for a free atom they are Δℓ = ±1, Δm_ℓ = 0 for linearly polarized radiation and Δm_ℓ = ±1 for circularly polarized radiation. Thus, for a K absorption edge, the transition will be to p states.

One must now treat the modification of the final state due to the presence of neighboring atoms, i.e., to the scattering of the photoelectron by their potential. Because the principal interaction of the photoelectron is with the core‐level electrons of surrounding atoms, the muffin‐tin approximation for the scattering potential is commonly adopted. This consists in spherically averaging the potential around each atom and adopting a constant interstitial potential in between. In this approximation, the calculation of the absorption cross section is simplified into a multiple‐scattering problem of the final‐state wave function by a collection of spherically symmetric scattering centers.

Under these assumptions, for a randomly oriented polycrystalline sample the polarization‐averaged cross section for a transition to a final state of angular momentum ℓ is  
σ(ħω) = [σ₀(ħω)/(2ℓ+1)] sin²θ₀ Im ∑_{m_ℓ} [ (I – TG)⁻¹ T ]_{0,0}^{L,L} (10)  
where σ₀(ħω) is the atomic cross section. Each element of the matrices in Eq. (10) is identified by four indices: i, j running over the sites of the atoms surrounding the central one and L, L′ = {ℓ, m_ℓ} being angular‐momentum indices. I is the unit matrix, while T and G are the atomic‐scattering and propagator matrices in a local basis, respectively. The T matrix is diagonal in the atomic‐site and angular‐momentum indices,  
T_{i,j}^{L,L′} = δ_{ij} δ_{LL′} e^{iδ_i^ℓ} sin δ_i^ℓ,  
where δ_i^ℓ is the phase shift for the partial wave of angular momentum ℓ centered on the i-th atom. The G matrix has null diagonal blocks in the site indices (G_{i,i}^{L,L′} = 0) and describes the free propagation of the electron from site i to site j. Thus, the T matrix depends on the atomic composition of the sample, while the G matrix depends on the geometrical arrangement of the atoms.At sufficiently high energies above the edge (say 50 eV) the formal matrix expansion  
\(T\,(I-GT)^{-1}=TI + GT + GT\,GT + GT\,GT\,GT + \dots\) (11)  
in Eq. (10) is convergent; this leads to the multiple‐scattering (MS) series whereby the cross section can be written as the sum of a limited number of terms, each relative to a particular scattering path.  In the EXAFS region the cross section can be written as  
\[
\delta\mu(\omega)=\mu_0(\omega)\Bigl[1+\sum_{i\neq0}\chi_{0i}^{(2)}+\sum_{i\neq j}\chi_{0ij}^{(3)}+\dots\Bigr]
\]  
(12)  
where 0 identifies the central atom, the subscripts indicate the number of scattering “legs” and the superscripts indicate the scattering path, starting and ending on the central atom via atoms \(i\) and \(j\).  Scattering paths with two and three legs are pictorially represented in Fig. 3; paths with two legs are usually termed SS paths while those with three or more legs are termed MS paths.  An alternative decomposition of the cross section in the EXAFS region into irreducible n-body signals has been used by Filipponi et al. [21].

The matrix expansion (11) is not convergent in the near‐edge, or XANES, region.  Here a calculation of the spectrum implies the inversion of the matrix \((I-TG)\); this is the full multiple scattering (FMS) regime because an infinite number of scattering paths contribute to the XAFS cross section.

Sufficiently far from the edge, in the EXAFS region, the MS series is convergent and this leads to a compact expression for the EXAFS function (Eq. (6)) which is used for quantitative structural refinement.  Before proceeding, we must take into account some effects which have been neglected up to now.  Despite the success of a one‐electron picture, many‐body effects do have an appreciable influence on the fine structure and it is necessary to introduce some corrections to improve agreement between theory and experiment, the most important of which we now briefly discuss.

The first correction is due to the relaxation of the wave function of electrons not directly involved in the transition and leads to a reduction of the amplitude of \(\chi(k)\) by a factor  
\[
S_0^2=\bigl\langle C_i^{N-1}\mid C_f^{N-1}\bigr\rangle^2
\]  
(13)  
where \(C_i^{N-1}\) and \(C_f^{N-1}\) are the many‐body wave functions of the “passive” electrons before and after excitation of the “active” electron; the value of this amplitude‐reduction factor is usually between 0.7 and 0.9.

The second correction is due to the limited range of the excited electron within the matrix (at most ≃ 10 Å) and to the limited lifetime of the core hole (≃ 1 fs); both have the effect of damping the contribution to \(\chi(k)\) from distant atoms and this is, in fact, the origin of the local sensitivity of XAFS.  One may model these two effects with an effective electron mean free path \(\lambda(k)\), the value of which is energy dependent and ranges from a few ångströms to ≃ 10 Å.  In up-to-date data analysis schemes these effects are included in the effective scattering amplitude.

The third correction is due to thermal motion of the atoms.  The photoabsorption process occurs on the time scale of ≃ 10⁻¹⁵ s, in which the atoms may be considered as fixed in their instantaneous positions; hence, an XAFS spectrum, due to a very high number of excitation processes, probes the configurational average of the atomic positions.  Thermal motion gives rise to the so-called Debye–Waller (DW) factor, which for an SS contribution to \(\chi(k)\) involving atoms 0 and \(i\) and for motion in a harmonic potential is  
\[
\sigma_i^2=\bigl\langle\bigl(\hat r_{0i}\cdot(\tilde u_0-\tilde u_i)\bigr)^2\bigr\rangle
\]  
(14)  
where \(\langle\dots\rangle\) denotes a configurational average, \(\hat r_{0i}\) is the unit vector joining atoms 0 and \(i\), and \(\tilde u_i\) is the instantaneous deviation of the position of atom \(i\) from its average position.  An important point is that the XAFS DW factor depends on the degree of correlation of the vibration of the two atoms, while the DW factor which affects the intensity of XRD peaks depends only on the mean square deviation of each atom’s position with respect to its equilibrium value, projected in the direction of the wave‐vector difference.  The effect of moderate static structural disorder can also be taken into account by a supplementary DW factor.

With these approximations, the SS contribution to the EXAFS function can be written in a compact form.  With the central atom taken as reference, the neighboring atoms are grouped into coordination shells labeled by the index \(j\) and consisting of \(N_j\) identical atoms at the interatomic distance \(r_j\); in the harmonic approximation for thermal motion and for a randomly oriented crystalline powder sample we have  
\[
\chi^2(k)=S_0^2\sum_{j=\text{shells}}N_j\,f_j(r_j,k)\,\frac{\exp(-2k^2\sigma_j^2)}{k\,r_j^2}\,\sin\bigl[2kr_j+\phi_j+2\delta\bigr]
\]  
(15)  
where \(f_j(r_j,k)\) and \(\phi_j\) are the modulus and argument of the effective scattering amplitude of atoms in shell \(j\) and \(\delta\) is the phase shift due to the central atom.  The scattering amplitude depends also on the interatomic distance \(r_j\), as the curved‐wave nature of the photoelectron wave function is taken into account; in the plane‐wave approximation, adopted in more elementary treatments, this dependence no longer exists.  If the sample is an oriented single crystal and if, as usual, a linearly polarized photon beam is used, each atomic correlation will contribute to \(\chi(k)\) with a weight \(w_{0i}\) which depends on the relative orientation of \(\hat r_{0i}\), the unit vector joining atoms 0 and \(i\), and the direction of polarization \(\hat\varepsilon\); a simple expression for this weight can be obtained in the small‐atom approximation in which the spatial extension of the atoms…The scattering region associated to each neighboring atom is neglected with respect to the photoelectron wavelength: w₀ᵢ = 3^"  ^r₀ᵢ (16). Despite the apparently crude approximation, this weighting factor is very useful to estimate linear dichroism effects.

Contributions to χ(k) due to multiple‐scattering (MS) paths have a form similar to Eq. (15). It can be shown that the MS contribution of order n, due to a set of atoms whose coordinates are identified by a path index β={rᵢ} and for which the total scattering path length is r_G, is of the form χᵦⁿ = Aₙ(k, β) sin(k rᵦ) + Φₙ(k, β) + 2ζ[β] (17).

The total EXAFS function will be the sum of all the single‐scattering (SS) and MS paths, as indicated by Eq. (12). In principle there is an infinite number of such paths, but in practice their number is limited by the rapid damping of the signal for long path lengths (usually paths longer than ∼10 Å have negligible amplitude) and by the fact that the amplitude of the MS signal quickly decreases with the order n (paths with n > 4 can generally be neglected). MS paths are weak in the EXAFS region but must be taken into account for accurate structural determination; for instance, collinear paths due to three atoms in a row give rise to strong contributions to χ(k) from scattering paths composed of three or four legs, as in rock‐salt structures. In the diamond structure, the importance of MS paths in the EXAFS region was first pointed out by Bianconi et al.

Because the EXAFS function is the sum of sine functions whose argument is k r_G, a Fourier transform (FT) of χ(k) will exhibit peaks corresponding to the path length; the FT is usually plotted as a function of half the path length which, for SS paths, equals the interatomic distance. In Fig. 4 we show the magnitude of the FT of the EXAFS spectrum at the Ga K‐edge in GaAs; the main contributions to the first three peaks arise from the first, second and third coordination shells of the zinc‐blende structure.

From the analysis of an EXAFS spectrum the following local structural parameters can be obtained:
- Interatomic distances R (typically ±0.005 Å for the first shell),
- Identity of neighboring atoms and their coordination number CN (typically ±10 %),
- Debye–Waller factor σ² (typically ±5×10⁻⁴ Å²), provided a Gaussian model for the radial distribution function is appropriate.

EXAFS analysis requires an adequate starting structural model, which can be obtained from prior knowledge of the sample. A modern analysis usually is based on a simulation of the EXAFS signal and subsequent refinement of the local structural parameters via a least‐squares routine. A description of data analysis methods is beyond the scope of this paper; the interested reader is referred to existing literature and manuals. Useful lists of XAFS software can be found at xafs.org, i-x-s.org and esrf.fr/computing/scientific/exafs/xafs.html.

#### 1.4 XANES or near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure
In the near-edge spectral region, the MS series does not converge and thus it is not possible to express the cross section as a sum of sine functions. A simulation of the XANES region requires the inversion of the matrix (I – T G) and is relatively time-consuming in terms of computer calculations. The XANES line shape is sensitive both to the details of the scattering potential (because of the low energy of the photoelectron) and to the three-dimensional positions of atoms contained within a radius greater than that necessary to reproduce EXAFS. As a consequence, quantitative analysis of XANES is not generally possible at present.

An interpretation of XANES spectra in terms of electronic structure is also possible. If one neglects the energy dependence of the matrix element in a limited range of the near-edge region, the absorption cross section is proportional to the density of final states (in the presence of the core hole), selected in angular momentum by the transition rules and projected on the absorbing atomic species. This interpretation links XANES to electronic‐structure calculations and is often used for small molecules.

XANES finds widespread application in many fields, often with a “finger‐printing” approach in which the spectrum of a sample is compared to those of reference compounds of known structure. For example, XANES spectra of transition‐metal compounds exhibit clear differences with oxidation state and coordination. Analysis of the XANES spectrum provides information on the site symmetry of the absorbing atom (e.g., tetrahedral or octahedral) and on its oxidation state.

Because XANES is sensitive to three-dimensional atomic geometry (while the dominant contributions to EXAFS are essentially one-dimensional) and because XANES spectra are more easily recorded than EXAFS ones (especially for dilute elements), quantitative interpretation of XANES would be of great interest. In semiconductors, recent work has shown that comparison between experimental spectra and ab initio simulations can determine the three-dimensional structure of defects, such as the nitrogen–hydrogen complex in dilute nitride alloys. Significant progress has also been made in structural fitting of XANES spectra for biomolecules.Let us conclude mentioning that in the important case of the L-edges of transition metals, in which a p electron makes a transition to a narrow d band, multiplet theory is used to interpret the spectra because of strong electron-correlation effects. A useful review on these aspects has been written by de Groot [32]. L-edge spectra have been used to study the local structure of Mn in dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs), as will be described in Section 3.

## 2. Detection schemes and experimental setups relevant for semiconductor research
In this section, the main experimental setups relevant for semiconductor research are described. An essential requirement for any XAFS experiment is a brilliant synchrotron-radiation source and appropriate optics to provide a focal spot on the sample with the required photon flux, bandpass, stability, divergence, and spot size. Considerable progress in this field has been made in recent years [33–38]. Here, we focus on the experimental chamber itself and the appropriate detection schemes. The objective of any XAFS measurement is to record, as a function of photon energy, a quantity directly proportional to the cross section of the atom of interest in its specific environment or phase. Several methods have been devised and are described below. For diffraction anomalous fine structure (DAFS) we refer to Chapter 11 by Proietti et al.

### 2.1 Transmission geometry
A transmission measurement of XAFS is the most commonly used. It relies on measuring the flux of monochromatic photons incident, \(I_0\), and transmitted, \(I_T\), by a sample of thickness \(x\). The inversion of Eq. (1) gives  
\( \mu(E)\,x = \ln\frac{I_0(E)}{I_T(E)}\) (18)  
where \(\mu(E)\) is the absorption coefficient. The main requirement for this measurement is that the discontinuity in \(\mu x\) be in the range 1–2 and that the lateral homogeneity of the sample be high enough to avoid “thickness effects.” In practice, sample thicknesses must be 1–10 μm with homogeneities within a fraction of this; hence transmission measurements are usually not practical in the soft-X-ray range, where required thicknesses are too small to fabricate homogeneous samples. The transmission technique can be applied when the atom of interest is not dilute or is not at or near the surface; its main advantage is very good signal-to-noise ratios, as it relies on high photon fluxes (10^9–10^11 photons/s). The most commonly used detectors for transmission measurements are gas ionization chambers.

In semiconductor heterostructures and nanostructures, one often studies ultrathin films, nanolayers, or low-dimensional structures on or near the surface. Pristine samples are thus not usually appropriate for transmission mode, as the substrate or matrix background would be too high. As a notable exception, Ridgway’s group [40] devised specific sample-preparation procedures involving etching of the substrate and stacking of various layers of the sample of interest to achieve an equivalent thickness suitable for transmission measurements; by combining this with low temperatures (which reduce the Debye–Waller factor, Eq. (14)), these authors obtained data of excellent signal-to-noise ratio.

### 2.2 Decay channels: fluorescence and electron yield
Reduction of background absorption from the matrix can be achieved by selectively recording an atom-specific signal. One can exploit the decay of the photoexcited atom, which occurs either via emission of a fluorescence photon (characteristic radiation) or of an Auger electron; both have energies that depend on the atomic number of the photoexcited atom.

#### 2.2.1 Fluorescence yield detection
In the fluorescence-yield (FY) detection mode [41], a photon detector records the fluorescence intensity as a function of energy. In the most common geometry with horizontally polarized X-rays, the detector is placed in the horizontal plane at right angles to the incident beam to minimize elastic scattering. In this geometry, the fluorescence intensity \(I_f(E)\) of atom A embedded in matrix M for a sample thickness \(d\) is  
\( I_f(E) = I_0(E)\,\frac{\varepsilon_f\,\Delta\Omega\,\mu_A(E)}{\mu_{\rm tot}(E)+\mu_{\rm tot}(E_f)\tan\theta}\Bigl[1 - \exp\bigl(-[\mu_{\rm tot}(E)+\mu_{\rm tot}(E_f)\tan\theta]\,d\bigr)\Bigr]\) (19)  
where \(\varepsilon_f\) is the FY, \(\Delta\Omega\) the detector’s solid angle, \(E_f\) the fluorescence-photon energy, \(\theta\) the angle between the beam and sample surface, and \(\mu_{\rm tot}=\mu_A+\mu_M\) the total absorption coefficient. Because \(\mu_{\rm tot}\) depends on \(\mu_A\), Eq. (19) is not generally proportional to \(\mu_A(E)\). Proportionality is recovered in two limits: thin samples (series expansion of the exponential truncated at linear term, typically \(d<100\) nm) and thick samples in which atom A is dilute (\(\mu_{\rm tot}\approx\mu_M\), often below a few atomic %). If these conditions are not met, fluorescence data can be corrected for nonproportionality (“self-absorption”) as described by various authors [42–47].

Many detector types have been used for FY mode, but the most common are solid-state Si:Li or (nowadays) hyperpure Ge diodes.## 2.2.1 Fluorescence Yield Detection

Multielement arrays have an energy resolution in the range of 150–200 eV at 6 keV, a reasonable trade-off between counting rate and background rejection; for example, the spectrum of photons emitted from a sample consisting of 10^16 Sn atoms/cm² implanted in SiO₂ recorded on the GILDA beamline of ESRF shows elastic scattering, inelastic (Compton) scattering and Sn fluorescence clearly identified. As pulse-counting electronics is used, care must be taken to avoid or correct dead-time effects.  

Because both the probe and the detected signals are penetrating X-rays, fluorescence yield (FY) is the best choice to study dilute elements in the bulk of materials. This has led to a wide application of XAFS to the study of dopants in semiconductors. The lowest concentration measurable in a FY-XAFS experiment ultimately depends on the magnitude of the inelastic scattering background in the specific experimental geometry. For the specific case of the LIII-edge of Er in GaAs or InP, the lowest dose measurable is 1–5 × 10^14 atoms/cm². In the more general case, the lowest detectable dose or thickness depends on the absorbing atom, the matrix and the experimental geometry; XAFS spectra on thicknesses equivalent to 1–0.1 monolayers are nowadays measurable with adequate signal-to-noise ratio, and even lower concentrations can be measured in specific cases.

## 2.2.2 Electron Yield Detection
The decay of the core hole can also occur with the emission of an Auger electron. This Auger electron creates a cascade of lower-energy (“secondary”) electrons due to multiple ionization and inelastic scattering processes. Various electron-yield detection methods exist, depending on which electrons are detected and how:
- **Total electron yield (TEY)**  
  The simplest method, often used in the soft X-ray region, consists of measuring the drain current using an electrometer that connects the sample to ground.  
- **Partial electron yield (PEY)**  
  Only electrons within a given energy range are detected by means of retarding grids and electron detectors.  
- **Conversion electron yield (CEY)**  
  In the hard X-ray range, where cross sections are smaller, the signal due to radiationless decay is recorded using a He-filled ionization chamber in which the sample acts as the anode; He gas acts as an electron multiplier and an amplified signal is recorded from the cathode.  
- **Auger electron yield (AEY)**  
  The number of Auger electrons themselves is recorded directly; this requires an electron analyzer operating in ultrahigh-vacuum conditions and is used only in surface XAFS experiments.

All electron detection modes are surface sensitive, due to the limited electron mean free path, making them particularly useful for investigating near-surface regions or interfaces. Depth sensitivity in TEY is typically a few hundreds to a few thousands of ångströms. Comparisons between TEY and CEY show that TEY is more surface-sensitive than CEY.  

Spectra recorded using electron detection methods may suffer from “self-absorption effects,” similar to those in FY, though generally less severe because the electron absorption coefficient is much higher than the photon absorption coefficient and thus dominates the denominator in Eq. (19). Correction procedures have been described in the literature.

## 2.3 Alternative Detection Methods
A number of nonconventional methods to detect XAFS have been proposed, each with its own advantages, limitations and pitfalls. Those relevant to the investigation of semiconductors are briefly reviewed here; results on specific systems are discussed in Section 3.

### 2.3.1 Optical Detection
When excited by an X-ray beam, many samples emit visible or near-visible radiation. X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) and the measurement of the XAFS spectrum via the resulting photoluminescence yield (PLY) have attracted considerable attention, owing to the possibility of determining the local structure of only the atoms involved in the luminescence emission, thus adding site selectivity to XAFS.  

XEOL was first observed in CaF₂; the PLY-XAFS spectrum actually exhibited an inverted jump (i.e., a decrease rather than an increase of the PLY at the edge). The roles of the attenuation lengths for the X-ray and optical photons and the sample composition in determining this behavior were subsequently understood.  

A fundamental issue is the effective site selectivity of PLY-XAFS: one must verify that the change of the PLY at the absorption edge of a particular atom is solely due to absorbers in the optically active centers. In many cases—particularly in scintillators or ionic crystals—the optically active center may be different or distant from the selected absorbing atoms. In a mixture of ZnS–ZnSe powders, where the two components emit at different wavelengths, site selectivity was clearly demonstrated; conversely, the important role of interion excitation has been shown in other doped samples.### 2.3.2 Electrical detection

The electrical detection of XAFS has been investigated by several groups with the objective of determining whether the local structure of only those atoms contributing to the electrical signal due to defects could be probed, leading to a potentially site‐selective version of XAFS.

Photocurrent‐detected XAFS spectra have been reported by Boehme et al. and Hu et al. for an Al–GaAs diode and for bulk GaAs, respectively. Their common conclusion is that, for these concentrated samples, once corrections for sample thickness are applied, the spectra contain the same structural information as traditional transmission‐mode measurements.

Ishii et al. proposed a capacitance‐detected version of XAFS using a Se‐doped AlGaAs–Al diode exhibiting the so‐called DX deep‐level electron trap. Since changes in capacitance arise from electrons localized in the traps, they argued it should be possible to determine the local structure of only those atoms near the trap. Indeed, their Ga‐edge spectra recorded in fluorescence and capacitance modes exhibit significant differences. Variations of the capacitance method have also been proposed: by changing the diode bias potential one can achieve depth selectivity, while scanning capacitance probes could provide lateral resolution on the length scale of an AFM.

The site selectivity of capacitance‐detected XAFS was challenged in detail by Bollmann et al. They studied samples with both DX deep‐level and antisite defects and found no significant differences between fluorescence‐ and capacitance‐mode spectra. Modeling of the X‐ray‐induced current and capacitance changes led them to conclude that defect centers can be ionized by electrons generated by core ionization of atoms distant from the defect, so no true site selectivity is achieved. More work is needed to resolve this issue before the detection mode can be widely accepted.

### 2.3.3 Beta environmental fine structure
In the context of precise neutrino‐mass measurements, it has been suggested that the β‐decay spectrum of a nucleus embedded in a crystal or molecule could exhibit fine structure analogous to XAFS: the emitted β particle (electron) is scattered by neighboring atoms, and interference effects modulate the decay rate, leading to so‐called beta environmental fine structure (BEFS). BEFS was detected in the decay spectrum of ¹⁸⁷Re, and since β‐emitting nuclei include tritium, ¹⁴C and several metals, BEFS could be highly valuable for materials physics and chemistry. The Re BEFS spectrum was later analyzed quantitatively, showing good agreement with the known crystal structure; an open issue concerning the angular momentum of the final state (s or p) has been addressed more recently. BEFS is potentially very powerful—especially for studying the local environment of hydrogen in semiconductors (where traditional XAFS is impractical because of the low K‐edge binding energy)—but it has yet to become a routine tool.

### 2.4 Specific experimental setups
#### 2.4.1 Grazing incidence
In a macroscopic picture, the interaction between an electromagnetic wave and a sample is described by the index of refraction. A wave traveling in the direction **x** is given by the phase factor exp [i (ω t – **k**·**x**)], where ω is the angular frequency and **k** is the wave vector, with magnitude |**k**|=k=2π/λ (λ is the wavelength) and propagation speed v=ω/k. In the X‐ray range the index of refraction can be written as  
n(hν)=1−δ(hν)+ i β(hν),  
where both δ and β are positive and ≪1; δ and β describe dispersion and absorption processes, respectively, and are related by the Kramers–Kronig relations. For Si at λ≈1.2 Å (hν=10 keV), δ≈9.8×10⁻⁶ and β≈1.5×10⁻⁷.

As a consequence, an X‐ray beam impinging on a flat surface may undergo total external reflection if the angle of incidence θ (measured between the beam and the surface) is smaller than the critical angle θc=√(2 δ). For Si at λ=1.2 Å, θc≈4.5 mrad. For θ<θc the reflectivity approaches 1 and the beam is confined to the near‐surface region. Compact expressions for the penetration depth Λ (normal to the surface) are:
- For θ ≪ θc: Λ=1/(2 k √(2 δ)) ≈2.2 nm  
- For θ = θc: Λ=1/(2 k √β) ≈26 nm  
- For θ = 10 θc: Λ=θ/(2 k β) ≈29 mm  

The last expression is the usual penetration length determined by the absorption coefficient (μ=2 k β) projected onto the surface normal.## 2.4.1 Grazing incidence XAFS

It has been shown that for ε = ε_c the beam intensity at the surface is four times the intensity of the incoming beam. The reflectivity is a complicated function of ε, δ and β, which approaches 1 for ε << ε_c and 0 for ε >> ε_c. It is clear that a strong confinement of the X-ray beam in the near‐surface region can be obtained by using grazing incidence.

The possibility of using grazing incidence to probe the surface region of materials was illustrated by Parratt [86]. For XAFS, Barchewitz et al. [87] were the first to record fine structure via the reflectivity R(ε_hω) and to suggest its relation with the absorption spectrum. Subsequently, Martens and Rabe [88] provided an in‐depth discussion, opening the way to what has been called the “RefleXAFS” technique. The fine structure in R(ε_hω) is related to the usual XAFS spectrum χ(k). However, extracting χ(k) from R(ε_hω) is not straightforward in the general case, since R(ε_hω) depends on both δ(ε_hω) and β(ε_hω) in a complicated way; of course, the usual XAFS spectrum is contained in β(ε_hω). A simplification arises sufficiently far from the edge and for ε < 0.8 ε_c, as it can be shown [89] that σ(ε_hω) = (1 − R(ε_hω)) / (1 + R(ε_hω)). (24)

A number of methods have been proposed to extract an XAFS spectrum from the reflectivity, each with its advantages and limitations [88–91]. Instead of measuring the reflectivity, FY or TEY may be used [92]; for a dilute or thin sample, a spectrum recorded in this way is directly proportional to σ(ε_hω) and does not require corrections [93]. Grazing incidence XAFS is a powerful tool to study surfaces and interfaces and has been used also to study semiconductor nano‐ and heterostructures.

## 2.4.2 Surface X-ray absorption fine structure
The potential of XAFS to determine the local structure of interfaces deposited in situ in an ultrahigh‐vacuum environment was realized early on [59,60]. As far as use of the EXAFS spectral region is concerned, this has led to the acronym SEXAFS for “surface EXAFS.” The specific advantage of surface XAFS for the study of heterostructures is the possibility of determining the atomic environment in the first few coordination shells of an excited atom in the epilayer (with an error of the order of 0.01 Å for the interatomic distances), during the formation of the interface, without exposure to the atmosphere. This information is crucial for a correct physical modeling of interface properties and now can be usefully compared to ab initio structural simulations. By exploiting the dependence of the XAFS cross section on the relative orientation of the sample and the linearly polarized synchrotron radiation beam, the structure parallel and perpendicular to the growth plane can be determined [94,95]. When information on the long‐range order is necessary, surface XAFS can be usefully coupled to grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (XRD). Surface XAFS has been reviewed a number of times; some of these reviews are listed in Refs [96–98].

Surface XAFS relies on detection schemes which are able to distinguish the signal originating in the interface from that originating from the bulk: TEY, PEY or FY, often combined with grazing incidence, all of which have been described previously. Of course, the further requirement is of an ultrahigh‐vacuum chamber connected to the beamline and equipped with all the instrumentation required to prepare an atomically clean and ordered surface and to deposit and characterize ultrathin epilayers. A particularly detailed description of a well‐equipped surface XAFS apparatus has been reported by Oyanagi et al. [99].

## 2.4.3 Micro-XAFS
As brighter synchrotron sources have become available, it has become possible to obtain smaller focal spot sizes and to design instruments capable of increasingly higher spatial resolution. In fact, the field of X‐ray microscopy has progressed very rapidly in recent years; lateral resolutions of the order of 10 nm have been obtained with photoelectron imaging techniques, e.g., the photo emission electron microscope or PEEM (see Locatelli et al. [100] for an example of a spectromicroscopy beamline using photoelectron imaging, and Ratto et al. [100] for an application to Ge dots on Si).

There is a great interest in performing XAFS with high lateral resolution (micro‐XAFS) as it allows a new level of description of heterogeneous samples, combining microscopy with the atomic‐scale structural information obtainable from XAFS; with sufficiently small focal spots the local atomic environment of single nanostructures might be determined. The challenge is to record XAFS spectra free of systematic errors and with sufficiently good signal‐to‐noise ratio. At present, XAFS spectra can be recorded with spot sizes of the order of a few square micrometers, for example on the ID22 beamline [101] of the ESRF or on the LUCIA beamline [102] of the SLS; micro‐XAFS is often complemented with microfluorescence mapping. Applications of micro‐XAFS to semiconductors have been relatively limited so far, but significant progress is expected. Micro‐XAFS is particularly useful when samples exhibit lateral inhomogeneities; many applications in semiconductors have been on samples whose growth has yet to be optimized, for example dilute magnetic semiconductors based on GaN (see Section 3). In several synchrotron radiation laboratories, efforts are under way to combine information derived from XAFS with the nanometer‐level lateral resolution obtainable by using atomic force microscope tips [103]. While photon‐based techniques may never reach the sub‐ångström spatial resolution of electron microscopy, recent advances represent many orders of magnitude improvement in spatial resolution. In the future, micro‐XAFS will certainly become a powerful tool in materials science, complementing spatially averaged techniques which have been key to the success and widespread use of X‐rays for structural determination.

# 3 A review of the use of XAFS in the field of semiconductor heterostructures and nanostructures
In the field of materials science, new growth and deposition schemes are continuously devised with the objective of obtaining samples and devices with novel physical properties. The role of highly sensitive and sophisticated methods such as XAFS is to provide a description of the local atomic environment which can form the structural basis for understanding the physical properties. In the past 20 years, XAFS has developed from an intriguing physical phenomenon to a tool that is used in many branches of science. In this section, an attempt is made to review the use of XAFS in the study of the local atomic environment of semiconductor heterostructures and nanostructures. This is a rather wide field and the choice of examples is partially a personal one. Not all aspects of semiconductor science are covered; for example, the important application of XAFS to the study of dopants, implanted atoms and defects is not included.### 3.1 Bond lengths in strained III–V heterostructures

The study of the effect of strain on the local atomic structure, especially on bond lengths, is an area in which XAFS has provided key results, clarifying what initially seemed a rather confusing situation. The applicability of XAFS to study small bond‐length variations in (unstrained) semiconductor pseudobinary alloys was demonstrated in pioneering papers in the 1980s [104,105]. The main result of these investigations is that bond lengths exhibit a variation with relative concentration which is significantly weaker than that exhibited by the lattice parameter. In fact, the lattice parameter of a pseudobinary semiconductor alloy of composition AₓB₁₋ₓC and zinc blende structure generally obeys Vegard’s law,  
a(x) = x a_AC + (1 – x) a_BC (25)  
where a_AC and a_BC are the lattice parameters of the binary compounds. Experimentally, the bond lengths R_AC and R_BC exhibit a much weaker dependence on x. This can be qualitatively understood as due to the “rigidity” of semiconductor bonds and implies the existence of local distortions (variations of bond angles).  

Cai and Thorpe [106] proposed a comprehensive theory of bond‐length variation in semiconductor alloys, able to reproduce existing experimental results and with predictive ability. A basic ingredient of their work is the assumption that there are no differences between bond‐stretching and bond‐bending force constants in elemental tetrahedra centered on different atoms, and that an average value applies in all cases. XAFS is the appropriate tool to study this problem because of its chemical selectivity and high resolution at the short‐distance scale.  

A pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of XRD patterns has also recently been shown to determine interatomic distances in bulk InGa₁₋ₓAsₓ samples [107], and ab initio structure determination of randomly oriented nanostructures is in principle feasible [108]. The PDF can be obtained for bulk ZnSe₁₋ₓTeₓ from neutron diffraction data [109]. An advantage of PDF analysis is its combined short‐ and medium‐scale sensitivity, while a limitation is its applicability to thin crystalline epilayers.  

When a cubic epilayer is grown pseudomorphically on a substrate with a different lattice parameter, below a certain critical thickness its unit cell undergoes a tetragonal distortion. The perpendicular and parallel strains are defined as  
ε⊥ = (a⊥ – a_f)/a_f  
ε∥ = (a∥ – a_f)/a_f  
where a_f is the epilayer’s free (unstrained) lattice parameter. For two‐dimensional growth on a (001) substrate the strains are related by  
ε⊥ = –2 (C₁₂/C₁₁) ε∥ (26)  
with C₁₂ and C₁₁ the elastic constants. The open issue in the early 1990s was the effect of this long‐range strain at the local scale—on individual bond lengths. Given the known rigidity of semiconductor bonds, does strain affect bond lengths? In alloy epilayers, is the effect the same for different bonds, and how does it combine with alloy‐induced bond‐length variations? XAFS, often in fluorescence yield (FY) mode and sometimes in grazing incidence to enhance surface sensitivity and reject substrate contributions [110], proved to be the technique of choice.  

Bond‐length strain has been studied in SiGe/Si(001) alloys and, most clearly, in III–V semiconductor heterostructures. One approach measures bond lengths in a binary or fixed‐composition alloy epilayer as a function of thickness, to observe strain relaxation above the critical thickness. Alternatively, for an alloy epilayer below the critical thickness, bond lengths are measured as a function of composition: as the free lattice parameter varies according to Vegard’s law (25), one must distinguish strain‐induced bond‐length changes from those due to alloying.  

Initially, many authors [111–113] reported negligible bond‐length variations in strained layers, but with large error bars (±0.01–0.02 Å). The first clear report of strain‐induced bond‐length variation was by Kuwahara et al. [114], who measured the In–As bond length in InAs and InAs₀.₆P₀.₄ layers on InP(001). They found a clear compression at low thicknesses and an increase around the critical thickness for strain relaxation (see Fig. 7). Woicik et al. [115] obtained similar results for InAs/GaAs(001).  

Subsequent experiments on strained alloy layers as a function of composition provided definitive insight and led to a simple model for the effect. Romanato et al. [116] studied tensile and compressively strained InₓGa₁₋ₓAs epilayers on InP(001) (0.25 < x < 0.75), while Woicik et al. [117] investigated a buried In₀.₂₂Ga₀.₇₈As layer in GaAs, finding similar results. Romanato et al.’s data show that for strained layers the slope of the bond‐length vs. concentration plot is inverted compared to unstrained alloys (which follow Mikkelsen and Boyce’s classical results [104]). A simple model reproduces this remarkable effect.The strain-induced distortion for bonds in the [111] direction is predicted to be  
rst = a(x) / (2√3) (1 – C12/C11) ε‖ (27)

The effects of alloying and strain are summed linearly. As can be seen, the agreement with the data is excellent. A consequence of this model is that different bonds (e.g., In–As and Ga–As) actually respond to strain in the same way, despite the fact that bond stretching force constants are significantly different; this is not surprising as the alloying-induced variations were reproduced with average values of the force constants [106]. More refined methods to calculate bond lengths in strained layers, based on a valence force field potential, have been published by Woicik [118] and d’Acapito [119], with a similar degree of good success. The issue of the effect of strain on bond lengths can be considered as solved and measurements of variations of bond lengths in strained systems can now be used to determine strain, as will be described in the next section.

### 3.2 Atomic environment in nanostructures
XAFS has been used to determine the atomic environment in many semiconductor nanostructures. The applicability of XAFS to study the changes of the local environment in nanostructures as a function of their dimensions was recognized early in the development of the technique, as shown by the studies on metallic clusters performed in the 1980s [120–122]. These studies demonstrated that nanoparticles exhibit a contraction of bond lengths, a reduced average coordination number and an enhanced structural and vibrational disorder. XAFS is the technique of choice because its local sensitivity (which derives from the limited photoelectron mean free path and core hole lifetime) makes it extremely powerful in detecting even subtle changes in the local atomic environment; moreover, the method of analysis does not change with the degree of long-range order even in going from a dimer molecule to a perfect crystal, a situation which must be contrasted with the case of XRD, and there are no consequences of even great changes in the morphology of a nanoparticle on the analysis formalism. Here, the most important topics addressed using XAFS are reviewed.

#### 3.2.1 Ge quantum dots and islands on Si surfaces and related systems
The possibility of altering the physical properties of semiconductors by exploiting quantum size effects has led to the recent big interest in nanostructures. In this field, XAFS has provided key results, especially regarding the intermixing in Ge quantum dots and islands on Si. XAFS has the advantage of providing a local view of the atomic environment of the excited atom, thus providing quantitative information on intermixing and bond length strain in a direct fashion. The chemical sensitivity necessary to obtain information on intermixing can be obtained by XRD techniques only by exploiting anomalous dispersion. In this context, anomalous XRD at high momentum transfer has been successfully applied to determine composition and strain profiles of Ge islands on Si [123]; disentangling the contributions of strain, intermixing, and morphology to the XRD pattern required a significant amount of modeling. A limitation of XAFS for the ex situ study of uncapped dots and islands is that for thin samples the contribution from the surface oxide (or from other disordered phases) can be significant, which might complicate analysis; a solution is the use of a capping layer or performing an in situ experiment. In view of the advantages of XAFS in this field, a great deal of papers have been published, of which we review the most significant.

Ge islands on Si(001) are among the most studied systems. It is known that, due to the 4.2% lattice misfit, heteroepitaxial growth proceeds with the formation of a two-dimensional wetting layer, followed by the formation of dots which relieve the lattice strain (at the cost of an increase in surface energy); this is the so-called Stranski–Krastanov growth mode. XAFS experiments [124] on Ge dots formed on Si(001) and Si(111) were among the first to detect the presence of atomic intermixing by any technique, a phenomenon which had been neglected up to that time; other evidence for intermixing from XAFS was provided by Kolobov et al. [125] and Erenburg et al. [126]. The experimental evidence is rather clear, asFigure 9 compares the Fourier transform (FT) of Ge K-edge spectra for bulk Ge, a Ge impurity in crystalline Si, and a representative sample of Ge dots on Si(001). The asymmetrical lineshape of the first peak (first coordination shell) indicates a significant number of Si neighbors around the average Ge atom; this has been confirmed by spectral fitting. It is now accepted that diffusion of Si atoms from the substrate reduces the strain energy associated with heteroepitaxial growth and is a key feature of quantum-dot formation. Hence, the appropriate growth mode for these dots is a modified Stranski–Krastanow one. Motta et al. [128] monitored the evolution of intermixing on the Si(111) surface, finding enhanced interdiffusion with increasing substrate temperature. Direct information on intermixing from XAFS was also illustrated by Kovats et al. [129], who found that intermixing was inhibited when dangling bonds on the Si(111) surface were saturated by B atoms.

Kolobov et al. [130] compared XAFS to Raman spectroscopy for local studies of Ge quantum dots on Si, showing that the overlap of a Si-substrate Raman peak with the Ge signal limits Raman’s applicability. The same group detected considerable atomic intermixing in capped Ge dots; the extent depends on the capping-layer growth temperature [131] and can be eliminated by growth on SiO₂ [132]. The second- and third-shell interatomic distances (obtained by including significant multiple‐scattering paths) reflect the strained state of the dots. d’Acapito et al. [133] also used bond lengths to quantify Ge-dot strain.

Atomic intermixing is not limited to group-IV dots: in III–V systems, Galluppi et al. [134] first detected In/Ga intermixing in nominally pure InAs dots on GaAs by In K-edge XAS, correlating these structural measurements with photoluminescence. d’Acapito et al. [135], using grazing‐incidence measurements on 1.3–3 monolayer (ML) thick samples, confirmed these results and showed that bond lengths reliably indicate dot strain. Finally, Renevier et al. [136] contrasted InAs/GaAs dots (showing interdiffusion) with InAs/InP quantum wires, where no group-V interdiffusion was found.

### 3.2.2 Embedded semiconductor nanoparticles
Semiconductor nanoparticles embedded in a dielectric medium exhibit unique optical properties due to quantum‐size effects and increased surface-to-volume ratios. Ion implantation followed by thermal annealing is a flexible method to create such nanoparticles near the surface of a dielectric. Here we review XAFS studies of Ge, GaN and II–VI nanoparticles in various (mostly amorphous) matrices.

Ridgway’s group studied Ge nanocrystals in silica and found two main results [137, 138]:
- For mean sizes of 14 nm, Ge retains tetrahedral coordination but shows enhanced Gaussian and non-Gaussian disorder compared to bulk crystalline Ge, highlighting XAFS sensitivity to short-range radial distribution.
- Ge nanocrystals amorphize under Si-ion irradiation at doses 100× smaller than required for bulk Ge. Fourier transforms of Ge K-edge XAFS data (Fig. 10) reveal strong damping of second- and third-shell signals (3–5 Å) in nanocrystals. Possible causes include interface-preferential amorphization, intrinsic nanocrystal instability, enhanced vacancy concentration, and ion-beam mixing.

Borsella et al. [139] fabricated GaN quantum dots (~5 nm) in crystalline (quartz, sapphire) or amorphous (silica) dielectrics by sequential Ga and N ion implantation (doses ~10^17 cm⁻²) followed by NH₃ or NH₃/H₂ annealing (900–1200 °C, <1 h). The wurtzite‐phase dots show quantum confinement in optical spectra. Ga K-edge EXAFS (Fig. 11) confirms local wurtzite structure but reveals reduced second-peak amplitude relative to the first, indicating partial Ga incorporation in clusters and some Ga–O bonding in the matrix.

Hayes’s group studied CdS nanoparticles (2–6 nm) in borosilicate glass, formed by 0.1 wt% CdS doping, quenching and annealing (625–900 °C). These particles exhibit blue-shifted optical absorption edges. Cd-edge XAFS [140, 141] shows Cd both in nanoparticles and dispersed in the glass, with high structural disorder. Fourier transforms of samples (as-received and annealed 14 h at 700 °C, Fig. 12) display a shift to higher distances of the first peak upon annealing and absence of features beyond the first peak in the as-received sample. The first and second shell distances are within 0.2% of bulk values, indicating low overall strain.Interfacial tension, suggesting that the glass matrix is able to accommodate and relax strains, increasing the particles’ stability.

### 3.2.3 Metallic nanostructures embedded in silica
Metallic nanocrystals embedded in amorphous SiO₂ on Si(001) have been recently investigated in view of their nonlinear optical properties, with applications ranging from optical fibers, memories, and switching devices. XAFS has been employed by several groups to study the variations of the local structure as a function of particle size and processing, and its relation to the physical properties.

Spiga et al. [142] have investigated the formation and the structural properties of Sn nanocrystals produced by ion implantation in ultrathin silica films, using grazing‐incidence XAFS in conjunction with Mössbauer spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The analysis of this system is complicated by the multiple oxidation states of Sn.### 3.2.3 Sn and Au Nanoclusters Formed by Ion Implantation and Annealing

Sn ions were implanted at 80 keV with a fluence of 10^16 cm^–2, positioning the peak of the implantation profile in the middle of an 85 nm–thick thermally grown SiO₂ film. After implantation, samples were annealed at 800–1100 °C; resulting Sn particle sizes ranged from 7 to 17 nm. In the as-implanted state all Sn ions are oxidized, with Sn^2+ oxidation states predominant, while annealing induces the formation of β-Sn nanoclusters. XANES provides qualitative information on the oxidation state and EXAFS measures local structural parameters; grazing‐incidence geometry enhances the signal from ultrathin films.

For particle sizes below 10 nm, a reduced coordination number and contraction of interatomic distances were observed. Even after annealing, complete precipitation of Sn into the metallic phase was not achieved, leaving a fraction of ions oxidized.

Kluth et al. studied Au nanocrystals fabricated by implanting Au ions at 4.5 MeV into 2 µm–thick SiO₂ at fluences from 10^16 to 3×10^17 cm^–2, followed by forming-gas annealing for 1 h at 1100 °C. Average Au particle sizes ranged from 2.5 to 10 nm. High-quality XAFS data revealed a bond‐length contraction of ~0.02 Å in smaller particles (with measurement uncertainty –0.002 to –0.005 Å), consistent with reports on nonembedded clusters and indicating negligible influence from the SiO₂ matrix.

The same group later investigated the effect of Sb irradiation (2.3 MeV, doses 10^14–10^16 cm^–2) as a method to tune nanoparticle properties. At low doses, significant disorder and bond‐length expansion occur; at higher doses, Au atoms partly dissolve into the matrix and form very small clusters (dimers, trimers).

### 3.2.4 Porous Si and Related Systems
Porous Si (p-Si), typically obtained by anodic etching of Si in HF, exhibits visible photoluminescence. Its origin has been attributed either to quantum‐size effects or to oxide‐related surface structures. XAFS—especially in photoluminescence yield (PLY/XEOL) mode—has been crucial in correlating atomic structure and luminescence.

- Sham’s group showed that TEY‐detected XAFS spectra are more sensitive to oxide, while PLY‐detected spectra resemble bulk Si, indicating that optically active p-Si locally retains the diamond structure.
- Pettifer et al. used time‐resolved PLY–XANES to distinguish environments: the fast blue luminescence component is linked to SiO₂‐rich regions.
- The Trento group performed transmission‐mode EXAFS on freshly etched p-Si (oxide removed by HF), confirming the diamond structure and finding increased Debye–Waller factors with porosity. Comparison of TEY and PLY spectra showed that PLY‐detected EXAFS exhibits growing disorder with higher porosity, evidenced by decreasing amplitudes of the first three FT peaks.
- A partial PLY detection mode was proposed: by selecting emission energy (higher emission energy ↔ smaller emitting clusters), Dalba et al. demonstrated that the Si K‐edge shifts linearly with emission energy. Since the edge corresponds to transitions from a core level to the conduction‐band minimum, this supports the quantum‐confinement model for p-Si luminescence.from a few to a few tens of nanometers and lengths up to a few hundred microns. The wires are generally covered by an oxide layer. XAFS has provided an atomistic description of the structure of these systems. In particular, Zhang et al. [151] have studied Si NWs obtained by laser ablation of a mixed Si/SiO₂ target. XAFS measurements at the Si K-edge of the as-deposited samples and of samples with the oxide removed showed that the core of the NW maintains the diamond local structure, with increased disorder compared to bulk Si. The same group has also more recently studied [152] Si NW using PLY detection, identifying luminescence bands originating from the quantum-confined silicon crystallites, the encapsulating silicon oxide and the silicon–oxide interface.

Finally, we mention XANES studies on silicon nanodots embedded in a SiO₂ film, performed by recording TEY and PLY spectra by the Trento group [153]. The comparison has allowed to propose and validate a model for the origin of the observed enhanced photoluminescence. Both experimental and theoretical results show that the interface between the silicon nanocrystals and the surrounding SiO₂ is not sharp: an intermediate region of amorphous nature and variable composition links the Si to amorphous stoichiometric SiO₂. This region plays an active role in the light-emission process.

## 3.3 Nitride heterostructures and thin films
GaN and related materials have been intensely studied in recent years in view of the properties which make them attractive for applications: a wide band gap (in the blue–violet region), good thermal and chemical stability, and physical hardness. The most common crystal structure of nitrides is the hexagonal wurtzite one but cubic forms are also possible, albeit metastable. The wurtzite structure grows in the (0001) direction and therefore has a polar character which entails strong polarization fields (both intrinsic and piezoelectric). The cubic and hexagonal polytypes of GaN are very similar when viewed along the cubic (111) and hexagonal (0001) directions and because the formation of stacking faults is energetically favorable, stabilization of the hexagonal phase is sometimes difficult.

An important problem for this class of materials is the absence of substrates with comparable lattice parameters, crystal symmetry and thermal expansion coefficients; the most commonly used substrates are Al₂O₃, SiC, and Si. XAFS investigations have contributed to clarify the local atomic structure of nitride alloys, determine the local effect of strain due to heteroepitaxial growth, investigate the relation between the relative fraction of cubic and hexagonal phases of GaN films and the choice of substrate, and finally study the fine details of the local structure of GaN.

Miyano et al. [154] studied the variation of interatomic distances in wurtzite AlₓGa₁–ₓN alloys deposited by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on sapphire, with x in the range from 0 to 0.43. The films were about 1 µm thick, so no effect of the strain due to the growth was expected; XRD showed a linear variation of the a and c lattice parameters of the wurtzite structure as a function of x. Ga K-edge EXAFS allowed the authors to measure the interatomic distances in the first and second coordination shells around Ga, finding that the first-shell Ga–N bond lengths exhibit a variation with x which is much weaker than the variation of the lattice parameters. Essentially, this study extends to the wurtzite structure the classical results [104,105] on zinc blende III–V pseudobinary alloys.

The effect of strain due to heteroepitaxial growth was probed in two studies of GaN ultrathin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on SiC substrates [155] and AlN layers [156], both of which exploited the polarization dependence of the X-ray absorption cross section (see discussion in Section 1.3) to decouple the local structure parallel and perpendicular to the growth plane. For the case of SiC substrates the growth was found to be always relaxed, while the GaN on AlN films were found to be partially strained, due to the lower lattice mismatch; the degree of strain was found to depend on the substrate temperature and the ratio between the strain parallel and perpendicular to the interface was found to be in good agreement with estimates on the basis of the available elastic constants and macroscopic elasticity theory. These studies can be viewed as an extension to nitride epilayers of the previously described ones for III–V systems (see Section 3.1); it must be mentioned that nitride epilayers are intrinsically more defective than III–Vs, so an understanding of local distortions due to the heteroepitaxial growth is extremely valuable.

The effect of the substrate on the crystal structure of GaN thin films has been studied by Paloura’s group [157,158]. By using the polarization dependence of N K-edge XANES spectra, these authors were able to illustrate how an Al₂O₃(0001) substrate yields a wurtzite GaN film, that a Si(001) substrate yields a cubic film, and that a Si(111) substrate yields a mixed phase. The physical basis of this kind of study is that the atomic absorption cross section must exhibit (at least) the symmetry of the point group of the crystal structure in which the absorbing atom is embedded [159]. For zinc blende films the point group is T_d and the cross section is isotropic. For wurtzite films, instead, the point group is C₆v and the angular dependence of the cross section is given by  
σ_tot(ℏω,θ) = σ_iso(ℏω) + (3 cos²θ − 1) σ₁(ℏω)  (28)  
where θ is the angle between the polarization vector and the c-axis of the wurtzite structure and the two cross-section terms on the right-hand side do not depend on the angle; for θ = 54.7° (the so-called magic angle), the measured cross section will be equal to the isotropic one. It is therefore clear that angular-dependent measurements can distinguish between cubic and wurtzite films.An alternative explanation of the method, based on a molecular‐orbital framework, is reported in the quoted papers. Polarization‐dependent XANES spectra for GaN films deposited on Si(001) and Al₂O₃(0001) substrates show that films on Si(001) exhibit no polarization dependence—consistent with a cubic structure—whereas those on Al₂O₃(0001) display a clear angular modulation, indicative of a hexagonal phase. These studies illustrate a general XANES-based method to determine the symmetry of an investigated crystal structure; this technique has also been extended to other nitride films [160,161].

GaN films are highly defective: in addition to stacking faults that give rise to both cubic and hexagonal phases, point defects such as N vacancies and Ga antisites occur at relatively high concentrations. Katsikini et al. [162,163] have proposed that this defectivity causes significant structural distortions in the tetrahedral building block of the material. Analysis of fluorescence‐yield XAFS data at both the N and Ga K-edges revealed an elongation of ≈0.25 Å for a significant fraction of the four Ga neighbors of the average N atom. Ab initio structural simulations by Dimakis et al. [164] have confirmed this distortion, once again highlighting the unique sensitivity of XAFS to the fine details of local structure.

### 3.4. Dilute alloy heterostructures
In recent years there has been considerable interest in dilute alloy heterostructures, obtained by adding a concentration on the order of 10⁻³–10⁻² of a foreign atom to the epilayer. Two materials systems will be reviewed below: dilute nitrides and diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs). In these fields, XAFS has played an important role both as an atomic-level characterization tool—providing feedback to optimize growth procedures—and for understanding physical properties on the basis of local atomic structure.

#### 3.4.1. Dilute nitrides
The incorporation of small quantities (0.1–1 %) of an isoelectronic impurity with very different electronegativity and size into III–V semiconductor alloys causes dramatic and unexpected changes in physical properties. For example, adding nitrogen to GaAs, InGaAs or GaP leads to a giant (and counterintuitive) band-gap reduction and a lattice‐parameter decrease. These effects make dilute nitrides attractive for light emitters in the telecommunications wavelength range and for high‐efficiency solar cells. XAFS has been used to study atomic ordering in quaternary dilute nitrides and the structure of complexes formed upon hydrogen irradiation.

In the quaternary alloy (InGa)(AsN), cation and anion sublattices can be occupied randomly by In/Ga and As/N, respectively. This gives rise to questions about the degree of atomic ordering—i.e., the relative number of each bond type as a function of composition. In the low-N limit, short-range ordering (SRO) can manifest as samples having exclusively N–In or N–Ga bonds. Kim and Zunger [165] predicted a strong preference for In–N over Ga–N bonds, which would cause a significant blue shift of the band gap—counter to the red shift of applicative interest.

XAFS findings in 2003:
- Lordi et al. [166] concluded that the as‐deposited (InGa)(AsN) alloy has a random atomic distribution, while annealing increases the relative number of In–N bonds, moving the system toward a more stable SRO state.
- Uno et al. [167] reported similar qualitative trends upon annealing.
- Ciatto et al. [168,169] provided a quantitative analysis combining In K-edge EXAFS and N K-edge XANES. They compared the In–N coordination number with N concentrations measured by nuclear reaction analysis and found that as‐deposited samples are random, whereas annealed samples exhibit a statistically significant—but less pronounced than predicted—degree of SRO.

Another remarkable property of dilute nitrides is that hydrogen irradiation fully reverses the nitrogen‐induced changes: XRD of hydrogenated GaAsN shows disappearance of the GaAsN diffraction peaks, recovery of the GaAs lattice parameter, and reopening of the band gap. XAFS has been decisive in elucidating the nature of the hydrogen complexes responsible for these effects, through combined N K-edge XANES measurements and full-multiple-scattering simulations based on ab initio atomic coordinates.complexes in hydrogenated GaAsN, Ciatto et al. provided convincing evidence that dihydrogen–nitrogen complexes with C₂v symmetry are the most abundant. This finding contradicted all previous predictions of “in-line” N–H₂* complexes as the predominant species. In Fig. 16(a) we sketch the structures of some of the hydrogen complexes and in Fig. 16(b) the comparison between the simulations and the experiment; the best agreement is clearly found for the complexes with C₂v symmetry. This chapter nicely illustrates the high-energy resolution in XANES measurements which can be obtained in the soft X-ray range, the three-dimensional sensitivity of XANES, and the power of combined experimental–simulation studies.

### 3.4.2. Dilute magnetic semiconductors
A dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS) consists of a nonmagnetic semiconductor doped with a few percent of a magnetic ion (a transition metal, e.g., Mn or Fe). DMS thin films are typically obtained by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) growth on an appropriate substrate. In a DMS, the ions—ideally occupying substitutional sites in the semiconductor lattice—retain ferromagnetic alignment in the presence of spin-polarized free carriers.  

DMSs have been studied since the 1970s. Initially much work was done on II–VI-based alloys, later on III–V semiconductors, and more recently on nitrides; DMSs form the material basis of the emerging field of spintronics.

There are expectations that room-temperature ferromagnetism might be obtained in DMSs. Indeed, in 2000 Dietl et al. predicted that room-temperature ferromagnetism could be obtained by doping GaN or ZnO with a few percent of Mn. Three years later, ferromagnetism at 172 K was reported for p-type δ-doped GaAs:Mn and, in 2005, the same group reported a Curie temperature of 250 K in a specially designed heterostructure.

A great amount of work has been reported on DMSs; much of it is very recent and the panorama of results is continuously changing. Sample deposition procedures are far from optimized, which makes it difficult to draw certain conclusions. For the nitride- and oxide-based systems, the reader is referred to the recent and extensive review by Chambers for a materials science perspective. XAFS has played an important role in studies of DMSs, both initially at the level of basic characterization and then to gain insight into the relation between local structure and physical properties. This is also due to the rich chemistry and variety of oxidation states of transition metal ions, which can be accurately characterized by the technique. Moreover, it is important to note that ferromagnetism can also be observed if ferromagnetic precipitates are present in the material, but this does not qualify as a true DMS; hence, an atomic-level probe such as XAFS is of crucial value. For reasons of space, this section is limited to Mn-doped III–V semiconductors and GaN, which are probably the most intensely studied class of DMSs.

As is often the case, the first studies in the field were of a preliminary character. For InAs:Mn, Krol et al. reported that only a small fraction of Mn atoms was actually substitutional in the InAs lattice and most formed MnAs clusters. A few years later, using optimized sample preparation procedures and more accurate data analysis, the same group clearly highlighted the role of concentration and growth temperature: at low (< 1 %) Mn concentration and low growth temperature, substitutional Mn was clearly detected, while clusters with the local structure of MnAs precipitated at higher concentrations or substrate temperatures. The origin of this behavior is the limited solubility of Mn in III–V semiconductors; to avoid the formation of MnAs inclusions, the growth temperature for Mn-doped III–Vs has to be between 200 °C and 300 °C, i.e., very low compared to the 500–650 °C interval used for standard GaAs-based materials.

For the prototypical GaAs:Mn system, more work has been reported. In this system, there is a close interplay between the local structure of Mn and the electronic properties. By using DFT simulations, Mahadevan and Zunger predicted that the formation energy of an interstitial Mn defect decreases as the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band, which can occur as a consequence of Be codoping. Shioda et al. initially reported complete Mn incorporation in substitutional sites for concentrations below 7 % and growth temperatures of 250–300 °C; they measured a Mn–As bond length of 2.50 Å, which is 0.05 Å higher than the value for Ga–As and thus implies considerable local distortion. Later, Bacewicz et al. studied samples grown between 220 °C and 250 °C with Mn concentrations below 4 %; by a combined analysis of the XANES and EXAFS regions they detected a significant fraction of interstitial Mn atoms, though no correlation with other sample properties was reported.

More complex GaAs:Mn-based heterostructures have also been studied. Two methods were recently proposed as alternatives to the growth of bulk GaAs:Mn alloys: 
- **Digital GaAs/MnAs heterostructures**, obtained by alternately depositing layers of GaAs and MnAs.  
- **δ-doping of GaAs with Mn**, consisting of creating a δ-like doping profile in the growth direction by inserting in GaAs a submonolayer-thick Mn layer.  

In both cases, the basic idea is to achieve locally higher Mn concentrations where high hole densities are desired.Soo et al. [182,183] have studied Mn/GaAs digital alloys. They found that in samples deposited at the low temperature of 275 °C, Mn substitutes Ga and locally forms a GaMnAs alloy; upon annealing, a dramatic decrease of the first‐shell coordination number was found and the authors suggested that this was due to initial stages of precipitation of a MnAs phase. Later, the same group published [184] a convincing study, which combined the local structural sensitivity of Mn K-edge XAFS with an atom-specific magnetic probe such as X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) performed at the Mn L-edge. They found a high ferromagnetic alignment of the Mn atoms and a local structure exclusively composed of substitutional Mn in the Ga sites, as in a random (GaMn)As alloy. More recently, d’Acapito et al. [185] have studied a series of Mn d-doped GaAs samples, deposited at growth temperatures in the range 300–450 °C, with and without Be codoping. In low-temperature samples, Mn was confirmed to be substitutional to Ga. Interestingly, a direct correlation between Be codoping (which lowers the Fermi level toward the valence band) and the presence of Mn interstitials was demonstrated; this study illustrates the ability of XAFS to detect relatively small fractions of defective sites and to measure their local structure quantitatively.

XAFS has also made a significant contribution for the characterization of Mn-doped GaN films; again, it should be remarked that the nitrides are a more defective materials system than III–Vs and that a significant evolution in the near future is expected as the close interplay between growth and characterization will lead to improved materials. XAFS has provided important results on the site of Mn in GaN and its oxidation state.

Soo et al. [186] studied 150-nm-thick films deposited by MBE on Al₂O₃(0001) at substrate temperatures ranging between 400 °C and 650 °C, with a maximum Mn concentration of 2 %; magnetic measurements indicated that the samples were paramagnetic. EXAFS measurements indicated that Mn occupied a substitutional Ga site with a Ga–N bond length which was found to be ∼0.07 Å greater than the Ga–N one. XANES measurements on the samples were compared to several oxide and fluoride reference compounds in which Mn has known oxidation states and it was concluded that Mn has the +2 oxidation state. While this is certainly a reasonable conclusion, it should be remarked that, ideally, such comparisons should be performed with reference compounds of known structure and composition as close as possible to the samples; it is an unfortunate situation that this is not strictly possible with Mn-doped GaN.

In 2004, Thaler et al. [187] reported EXAFS data on Mn-doped GaN films grown by MBE on either Al₂O₃(0001) or MOCVD GaN substrates with and without a 2-µm-thick GaN buffer layer. Samples grown at 700 °C with the GaN buffer layers exhibited strong magnetization even above room temperature (but no remanence). The EXAFS measurements indicated that Mn was always substitutional, independently of the presence of the buffer layer; this result indicated the important role of the defect density of the GaN matrix in determining the magnetic behavior.

One of the concerns in the growth of Mn-doped GaN is the presence of multiple oxidation states of Mn and their spatial distribution. In this context, micro-XAFS has provided results that nicely illustrate the potential of the technique. By using an intense spot size of the order of 1 µm², Martínez-Criado et al. [188] performed a joint microfluorescence mapping and micro-XAFS experiment. Mapping of the Mn and Ga fluorescence intensity demonstrated their inhomogeneous distribution. Moreover, by performing maps of fluorescence intensity at specific excitation energies which correspond to XANES features of Mn in the Mn⁰, Mn²⁺, and Mn³⁺ oxidation states (chosen using as references metallic Mn, MnO, and Mn₂O₃) the authors were able to show the presence in the samples investigated of all three oxidation states, thus including metallic Mn, and their strongly inhomogeneous spatial distribution.

The presence of Mn³⁺ in a substitutional site in MBE-grown samples on a GaN buffer layer up to a concentration of 5.7 % was nicely demonstrated by Titov et al. [189] using high-resolution XANES measurements and their interpretation using band-structure calculations. This study illustrates the usefulness of simulations in cases in which an ideal reference compound does not exist. We conclude this section by quoting a combined X-ray absorption and XMCD study at the Mn L-edge by Keavney et al. [190]; by comparison with first-principles band-structure calculations, these authors propose that Mn preferentially populates Ga sites neighboring N split interstitials.

4. Summary and perspectives  
XAFS has established itself as a precious tool to study the local structure in the field of materials science. The underlying theory, which has been outlined in Section 1, is well understood and a number of reliable analysis programs are now available. Owing to the many possible detection modes, most of which have been described in Section 2, it can be applied to a great variety of systems and sensitivity to a particular phase, environment, or part of the sample can be enhanced on the basis of the experimental requirements. As a consequence, applications of XAFS to a wide variety of heterostructures and nanostructures, which have been reviewed in Section 3, have been widespread and have greatly contributed to the present understanding of the relation between atomic structure and physical properties.## Future Directions

There is no doubt that in the future XAFS will continue to be a valuable tool in this field of research. It is possible to outline specific areas in which progress is expected.

The spatial resolution of synchrotron radiation techniques has greatly improved recently [100–102], and certainly further advances will occur in the near future. Micro-XAFS is expected to be very valuable in two areas: characterization of inhomogeneous samples (with possible feedback to sample growth) and study of the local atomic environment of individual nanostructures. Concerning the last point, the challenge is to record spectra of sufficient quality and energy range to allow a quantitative interpretation; a strong effort is required in this area. If this issue is resolved, it might be possible to perform “bond length maps” of nanostructures.

Time-resolved XAFS has recently emerged as a very promising field, thanks to the full use of the time structure of storage rings and the pump-and-probe scheme (for a review, see Ref. [191]). Differential XANES spectra of a metastable charge-transfer state of an organometallic molecule with 100 ps X-ray pulses have been reported by Saes et al. [192]. A lot of work is currently underway in synchrotron radiation laboratories, and the future challenge is to use the femtosecond pulses of LINAC-based sources. Present time resolutions range many orders of magnitude, from seconds to picoseconds [191]. In semiconductor science, there have been only limited applications of time-resolved XAFS—for example, studies of photoexcitation of GaAs [193] and of melting of Si [194]. More work in this area is expected, for instance to study the kinetics of annealing-induced bonding changes, crystallization and amorphization, and aggregation and growth of nanostructures in real time.

Work is also in progress on interesting developments in the quantitative interpretation of the XANES region. XANES spectra contain a wealth of information, especially in view of the three-dimensional sensitivity; at present, even most advanced work in the solid state relies on a comparison between simulations and experiments, with semi-quantitative agreement. It would be a significant advancement to develop fitting methods—similar to those devised in the field of biomolecules [31]—for the quantitative determination of the three-dimensional structure of very small nanostructures, defects, and complexes in semiconductors. Finally, great progress is being made in ab initio structural simulations, with methods based on DFT theory. The accuracy of these methods and the reliability of XAFS analysis are such that joint experimental–theoretical investigations are now possible [30,171]. Simulations of the local atomic structure can be useful as a starting point for XAFS analysis, as a guide in the analysis itself, and as a very useful comparison with expected results. Further progress will certainly take place in both theory and experiment, in both the EXAFS and the XANES regions.
