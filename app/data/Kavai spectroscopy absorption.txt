INTRODUCTION:
X-rays are absorbed in matter and the energy of the X-rays is converted into the kinetic energy of photoelectrons, Auger electrons, secondary electrons, or fluorescent X-rays. The incident X-ray energy finally becomes the thermal energy of the absorber.The amount of energy absorbed by a matter is usually estimated by a transmission method, but can also be estimated by measuring these secondary phenomena, such as photoelectrons, Auger electrons, secondary electrons, fluorescent X-rays, thermal radiation, and drain electric currents. The X-ray intensity of wavelength l before (I 0 ) and after (I) the transmission of a thin film of thickness d is expressed by I l D I 0 l exp[ µ i l r i d], where µ i l and r i are the mass absorption coefficient and mass density, respectively, of the ith element in the thin film and their dimensions are [cm 2 g 1 ] and [g cm 3 ], respectively.where W 1 , W 2 , . . . , W n are the weight fractions of element 1, 2, . . . , n in the specimen. The wavelength dependence of the absorption coefficient µ l is clarified when log µ l is plotted against log l as shown in FigureThe plot of the mass absorption coefficients of matter against the incident X-ray energy or wavelength is called an X-ray absorption spectrum (XAS), where we find some jumps at particular X-ray energy, corresponding to K, L I , L II , L III , . . . Wavelength (Å) L edge K edge 0 Absorbance 1.4 1.2 1.0 L 3 L 2 L 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 Figure 2 Platinum powder XAS. (Reproduced by permission from Udagawa. 9 )FigureThe jump is called the absorption edge, and the wavelength is highly correlated with the atomic number similarly to Moseley's law 1 in X-ray emission spectra. Moseley's law in emission spectra is expressed as Equation (where l is the X-ray wavelength, Z is the atomic number, and K and s are constants for a spectral series. The absorption coefficient is crudely proportional to Z 4 l 3 except for the edge jumps. The energy at which the jump is observed is called the threshold energy, but the definition of the threshold is not exact, because it corresponds to the transition from a core orbital to the lowest unoccupied orbital. The ionization limit is a few or a few tens of electron-volts higher than the edge energy. The mass per unit area is given by rd, where r is the mass density. The linear absorption coefficient µ l is defined by µ l D µr, and its dimension is [cm 1 ]. The Xray attenuation length 1/µ l is the length at which the X-ray intensity becomes 1/e after traveling in matter. The attenuation length of Cu Ka 1 X-rays (8047.8 eV) is 79 µm in aluminum, 4.2 µm in iron, 24 µm in copper, and 3.9 µm in lead. The attenuation length of Al Ka X-rays (1486.7 eV) is 9.2 µm in aluminum and 0.4 µm in iron. The intensity of X-rays emitted by a copper target X-ray tube is, however, attenuated by only half after transmission through 2-mmthick aluminum, but depends on the applied power on the X-ray tube, because the X-rays emitted from an X-ray tube are not monochromatic. Thus it should be noted that the X-ray shielding thickness for safety cannot be determined only from the monochromatic Xray attenuation length.The linear absorption coefficient can otherwise be expressed as µ 1 D 4pb/l, where l is the X-ray wavelength and b the imaginary part of the complex refractive index (n D 1 d ib).where N is the number of atoms in unit volume and r 0 D e 2 / mc 2 D 2.818 ð 10 13 cm is the classical electron radius (e the electron charge, m the mass, and c the speed of light). The real part f 1 is the Fourier transform of the electron density distribution in an atom. The relation between the absorption coefficient and atomic form factor is used in DAFS described below.The mass absorption coefficient is the sum of two effects: photoelectric absorption and scattering of Xrays. The photoelectric absorption is the ionization of an inner-shell electron. Therefore, the absorption coefficient due to the photoelectric part can be calculated by the photoionization cross-section.The mass absorption coefficients or physically equivalent parameters 8,9 -13 and the absorption edge energy or wavelength 14,15 can be found in the literature. The value of the absorption edge energy is close to the electron binding energy, which is used in electron spectroscopy, ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis) or XPS (Xray photoelectron (photoemission) spectroscopy).

ACRONYMS AND A BRIEF HISTORY:
The mass absorption coefficient plotted against the Xray energy is called the XAS. The X-ray absorption spectra of condensed matter near the threshold energy have fine structures as shown in Figure, where E is the photoelectron kinetic energy, E 0 the threshold energy, m the electron mass, and h Planck's constant. The photoelectron matter wave in a condensed system propagates as a spherical wave and forms a standing wave as shown in FigureThe history of the development of the understanding and application of XAFS has an interesting feature, as stated by Lytle et al.,Photoelectron wave Scattered electron wave Figure 5 Schematic illustration of electron wave propagating and scattering in a solid. (Reproduced by permission from Udagawa. 9 )and thus XANES was called the Kossel structure. The Kossel theory was called short-range order (SRO) theory, because the electronic structures of unoccupied levels are mostly determined by orbital hybridization between the center atom and the nearest-neighbor atoms. On the other hand, Kronig 34 explained that fine structure was the result of the diffraction of photoelectrons as a matter wave when moving in a conduction band of a solid. The electron matter wave travels in a solid when the wavelength of an electron l e does not satisfy the Bragg condition, 2d sin q D nl e . When the Bragg condition is satisfied, then the electrons are scattered and leave the solid. His theory explained EXAFS and thus EXAFS was called the Kronig structure. His theory was called the long-range order (LRO) theory because the band structure is determined by the long-range periodic boundary conditions. Hayasi 35 considered that the electron waves that satisfied the Bragg condition form a standing wave in a solid, and thus the electron transition from an inner orbital to a standing wave state yields a maximum of X-ray absorption.Shiraiwa et al. 36 and Kozlenkov 37 improved the SRO theory to explain the EXAFS, but their method needed to solve a Schr ödinger equation to obtain the EXAFS. Sayers et al. 38 proposed a Fourier transform method to obtain local structural information on condensed systems. Owing to their Fourier analysis, we do not need to solve the Schr ödinger equation directly to obtain the local structure of matter. EXAFS had at that time great potential to be developed as a powerful method of analyzing the local structure of matter. The inelastic mean free path (IMFP) of a photoelectron is usually 2 nm. When the photoelectron is scattered inelastically, the coherence is forgotten. The coherent length, i.e. the length within which the electron matter waves emitted from a single source can interfere with each other, is an important length to apply in the EXAFS method to analyze a condensed system. When the IMFP is included in the LRO theory, it is equivalent to the SRO theory. The XAFS represents the unoccupied electron density of states for atoms, molecules, solids, or liquids. One of the inner shell electrons, say a 1s electron, is excited into a discrete or continuum unoccupied state by the incident Xray photon. The transition probability from the 1s to the unoccupied state equals the X-ray absorption intensity (only the photoelectric part is considered here), and thus the plot of the intensity against the incident X-ray energy is the XAS of a specimen. XANES is chiefly due to the transition from the inner shell to the unoccupied discrete level (Figure

Chemical Shift and Line Shape:
The XANES spectra show both the line shape modification and chemical shift 39 of the absorption edge or peak.

The source of the core level shift is the same as that of an ESCA chemical shift.In Figure

The effective positive charge of six-fold coordinated Al 3C is larger than that of four-fold coordinated oxide. The chemical shift of six-fold coordinated oxide is larger than that of fourfold coordinated oxide. The shift is strongly correlated to Pauling's electronegativity 43 of the neighboring atom, because the electronegativity determines the effective charge of the ion.The unoccupied discrete level is composed of Rydberg states in the atomic picture, p Ł and s Ł orbitals in the molecular-orbital picture (the asterisk denotes an antibonding molecular orbital), or conduction bands in crystals. The s Ł transition, which is formed in a potential well of neighboring atomic potentials, is called the shape resonance (FigureWhile the 1s ! p Ł transition is a sharp white line, the 1s ! s Ł transition usually results in a broad and weak hump at higher energy, 44 which is called the shape resonance. The term shape resonance is used in the field of atomic spectra. The excited state or ionized state is bound in a potential wall, because of the centrifugal force potential of a high angular momentum orbital such as an f orbital, or surrounding potential such as F in SF 6 . However, as shown schematically in FigureThe pre-edge structure shown in FigureAfter the discovery of high-temperature superconductors, 49 the understanding of the electron correlation effect of transition metal compounds 50 and rare earth compounds has been greatly improved by the study of XPS. Consequently, the understanding of the correlation effect, i.e. how the hole left in the final state of photoionization interacts with d holes in transition metal compounds, has developed substantially. Many reports have been published concerning the electron correlation effect on the XANES line shape of complicated materials.

Calculation Method for X-ray Absorption:
Near-edge Structure SpectraThe electronic states of photoelectrons whose kinetic energy is from a few electron-volts to a few tens of electron-volts are treated as conduction electrons in a conduction band. Thus a multiple scattering (MS) method or Green's function method, which has been used to calculate the electronic structure of conduction electrons near the Fermi energy in metals, is applicable to calculate the XANES of materials. The line shape of a XANES spectrum represents the partial and local electron density of states of the X-ray absorbing atom.In the MS theory, a sphere of radius r i centered at the ith atom is considered, and the solid is divided by spheres. A spherically symmetric atomic potential V r is put inside each sphere and the potential equals zero or constant outside the spheres. This is called the muffin-tin (MT) potential. The wave function in the solid is expressed as the overlap of spherical Bessel functions (radial part of the wave function) multiplied by the spherical harmonic functions (angular part of the wave function).The wave function y r of a photoionized electron is scattered by an atomic potential V r near the ionized atom, and finally it becomes itself after being scattered many times (Equationexp ikjr r 0 j jr r 0 j V r 0 y r 0 dr 0 4where k 2 D e is the kinetic energy of a photoelectron and k is real for e > 0 (photoionized electron), exp ikjr r 0 j / jr r 0 j represents a spherically expanding wave, and V r is the MT potential. This method is called the MS method, Green's function method, or Korringa -Kohn -Rostker (KKR) method.56 and was called the multiple scattering Xa (MS-Xa) method, because Slater's Xa exchange potential 57 is used in place of the Hartree -Fock (HF) exchange integral. The Xa method is also called the Energy (eV) 650 E T 640 Intensity Figure 12 Mn L 2,3 XAS (E) of MnF 2 compared with atomic 3d 5 multiplet calculation including the crystal field splitting (T). (Reproduced by permission from de Groot et al. 60 © 1990 The American Physical Society.)Hartree -Fock -Slater (HFS) method, and recently it has been developed as a local density approximation (LDA) theory. The calculation method for XANES spectra is a modified MS-Xa method.The wave function at point r is the sum of all the scattered waves multiplied by the phase factor. The LCAO-MO method is another choice for calculating the electronic structures of solid or molecules, and is thus applicable to the calculation of XANES spectra.

Single Scattering Theory:
Whereas MS of photoelectrons in a solid is a good approximation to treat XANES, because the electron kinetic energy of the EXAFS region is very high, single scattering is a good approximation to EXAFS except for special cases. The wave function f k r of a photoelectron scattered by a single atom is asymptotically expressed by Equation (where f # is the scattering amplitude and # is the scattering angle (# D 0 °for forward scattering and # D 180 °for backscattering). The scattering amplitude of an electron of velocity v scattered by an atom of atomic number Z is expressed by the first Born approximation (Equationwhere e and m are the charge and the mass of an electron, respectively, and A # is the atomic structure factor for X-rays, given by Equation (sin kr kr r r r 2 dr 7where k D 4pmv/h sin #/2 is the change in electron momentum before and after the scattering and r r is the charge distribution in an atom. The forward scattering amplitude crudely depends on the atomic number in a way such that (Equation3 1 0 4pr r r 4 dr D 1 3 Zhr 2 i 8 in atomic units, because (Equation 9) 62 Z D 1 0 4pr 2 r r dr 9where h i denotes an average. The calculated scattering amplitude is shown in Figurewhere k D p 2m hn E 0 /h is the photoelectron wave vector, N j is the number of nearest neighbors, jf k, p j is the backscattering amplitude, and R j is the distance from the center atom. The exponential term contains the Debye -Waller-like vibrational effect and dumping. The dumping due to the finite coherent length of the photoelectron, exp[ 2R j /l k ], is multiplied for a more exact expression. The Debye -Waller factor contains both effects of thermal vibration and geometric randomness. The oscillating part of the EXAFS equation, sin 2kR/ kR 2 , if plotted as a function of kR, is the EXAFS oscillation. The EXAFS oscillation amplitude is larger when the atomic number of neighboring elements is higher. For example, the Si K edge EXAFS oscillation amplitude of Si is stronger than that of SiO 2 , because the atomic number of Si is higher than that of O. The white line of SiO 2 is sharper and stronger than that of Si. Hence the EXAFS oscillation and the white line intensity do not directly indicate the concentration of the atom in the analyte. However, the edge jump is a good measure of concentration, and the measurement of edge jump could determine the concentration without a working curve, as shown in TableTable 5 Results of copper -zinc solution to test the trace element analysis Zn (µg mg 1 Edge jump Cu solution) 0.092 0.0059 0.049 0.0035 0.020 0.0021 0.000 0.0010 Reproduced by permission from Nomura. 65 © 1992 The American Chemical Society.

A shorter lifetime of the inner shell level indicates that the energy of the inner shell becomes vague because of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Consequently, the EXAFS oscillation of the K spectrum for higher atomic number elements is not clear compared with that of the L edge spectrum of the same element.The IMFP of photoelectrons is a function of kinetic energy for a particular material, as shown in Figure

Relation to Other Techniques (X-ray Photoelectron:
Diffraction, Low-energy Electron Diffraction, X-ray Fluorescence Holography)X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) 62 is used to study the local structure of surfaces. The photoelectron intensity as a function of detected polar and azimuthal angles is measured in this technique. The photoelectron intensity is anisotropic in its detection angle. This effect is due to photoelectron diffraction, but roughly speaking it is due to the photoelectron's forward scattering by the nearestneighbor atoms around the photoelectron-emitting atom. XPD uses forward scattering of photoelectrons; EXAFS uses backscattering of photoelectrons.Recently XPD has been treated as photoelectron holography (PEH).Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) 68 is a surface crystallography experimental method where electrons of a few hundred electron-volts impinge on a single crystal and a diffracted electron pattern is observed. The penetration depth of these energy electrons is a few nanometers, hence this method is surface sensitive. Electron diffraction requires a periodic structure of at least 10 nm on the surface, hence the LEED method cannot probe the structure clusters of a few nanometers on a surface.

The effect of an additional one or two electrons ionized from outer shell(s) is not negligibly small.EXAFS Fourier analysis is sometimes not easy when additional peaks such as multiple ionization, standing wave structure, and impurity peaks originating from the analyte, X-ray source, or X-ray optics emerge.Data analysis methods have been developed and several standard computer programs are now available.Table 6 XAFS analysis computer programs ATOMS FUSE AUTOBK G4XANES AUTOFIT GNXAS BAN LASE CDXAS MacXAFS CERIUS2 MURATA EDA REDUCE EX.TR.As REX EXAFIT REX2 EXAFS and FITEX SEDEM EXAFS (for Mac) TT-MULTIPLETS EXAFSPAK UWXAFS EXBACK WinXAS EXBROOK XAFS EXCALIB XAID EXCURVE98 XANADU FEFF XDAP FEFFIT XFIT FEFF is the most popular program that is used by EXAFS users.

Laboratory Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure:
To measure the X-ray absorption spectra, a strong X-ray source of continuous energy is required, such as white radiation from an X-ray tube or synchrotron radiation (SR). A metallic wheel is rotated in vacuum and a high electric potential is applied between the wheel and a filament. Thermal electrons are emitted from the filament and bombard the wheel target. Water flows inside the wheel to cool it against heating by the electron bombardment. To eliminate the heating, the wheel is rotated. Therefore, this type of rotating anode X-ray tube produces one order of magnitude stronger X-rays than the ordinary sealed X-ray tubes. The electron deceleration at the metal target converts the electron kinetic energy into X-ray energy. The X-rays thus produced are continuum X-rays in addition to characteristic X-rays and the maximum energy is the acceleration electric potential applied. The X-rays from the X-ray tube are then monochromated by a crystal monochromator using the Bragg diffraction condition. Then the monochromatic X-rays are incident on the specimen as shown in Figure

Synchrotron Radiation Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure:
Recently, SR has frequently been used as an X-ray source. Synchrotron is the name of an electron (or positron) accelerator made of an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) ring and electrons rotating inside the ring. High voltage is applied to the rotating electrons using variable-frequency radio waves and the frequency is synchronized with the electron rotation during the acceleration of the electrons in the ring. When the electron speed reaches close to the speed of light, a very sharp X-ray beam is emitted in a tangential direction because of the relativistic effect. This X-ray beam is called the SR. Usually SR from a storage ring is used. A ring in which electrons (or positrons) are rotated at a certain constant speed is called the storage ring. Usually electrons accelerated to a sufficient speed by a synchrotron or a linear accelerator are injected into the storage ring, and the tangential radiation when a magnet bends the electron beam is used as an X-ray source.The first crystal in the monochromator used in an SR beam line experiences a high heat load, and the lattice constant is slightly different from the second crystal. The crystal optics should be cooled by flowing water. To adjust the difference in the lattice constant between the first and the second crystals, usually one of the two crystals is independently finely moved by a piezoelectricTable 7 Third-generation SR facilities and Web sites ALSmechanism. The adjustment of the two crystals should always be monitored for the measurement of EXAFS for the 1000-eV range. The monitoring of the adjustment is done by measuring the incident X-ray intensity, which is maximized at every energy point scanned.

Secondary Yield Techniques and Applications:
The intensity of the monochromated X-rays is monitored by an ionization chamber. X-rays pass through the ionization chamber (I 0 ) and are then incident on a specimen, and the transmitted X-ray intensity is measured by another ionization chamber. The XAS is the plot of log I/I 0 against the X-ray energy. The absorption spectra are usually measured by this transmission method as shown in FigureThe photoelectron intensity for a single crystal has an anisotropy with respect to the observed direction because of the photoelectron diffraction. The angular average of the photoelectron intensity measured as the change in incident X-ray energy is the XAS. This method is called the photoelectron yield method. If Auger electrons are detected, this is the Auger electron yield method. The intensity of Auger electrons from a single crystal also has an angular anisotropy. The detection angle is therefore important for interpreting the observed data for these electron yield methods. Many kinds of electrons are detected, such as secondary electrons, core photoelectrons, valence photoelectrons, and Auger electrons, as shown in FigureThe electric drain current is of the order of 10 9 A when using a bending magnet SR beam line. The electric drain current is a measure of X-ray absorption, and this method is called the TEY method. This is because the drain current represents the sum of all the electrons emitted from the sample. The electrons produced in a solid are scattered in the solid as shown in FigureThe XFY method is not surface sensitive, because the fluorescent X-rays originate from as deep a location as the X-ray attenuation length. However, if XFY is combined with the grazing-incidence X-ray technique (FigureCEY. The X-rays are totally reflected on the surface and the evanescent X-ray wave penetrates only a few nanometers from the surface. X-ray reflectivity is also a measure of XAFS. The grazing exit angle method is also possible, as shown in FigureThe X-rays emitted from a deep location in a specimen suffer from the self-absorption effect and the spectral shape is different from that of an absorption-free spectrum.Some materials emit luminescence in the visible wavelength range when irradiated with X-rays.

St öhr et al., 'Surface Crystallography by Means of Electron and Ion Yield SEXAFS', Surf. Sci., 117, 503 -524, © 1982, with permission from Elsevier Science.)amount of X-rays absorbed by the specimen. Various processes of optical luminescence de-excitation are shown in FigureThe chopping frequency usually ranges from a few to a few hundred hertz. The sound wave is detected by a microphone or a piezoelectric device. When the chopping frequency is low, the heat diffuses into deeper location in the sample compared with when it is high. Thus the probing depth is variable by changing the chopping frequency. All the incident photon energy is finally converted into thermal energy through nonradiative transition processes in the solid. The PA process in the visible wavelength range is used for the very sensitive absorption spectrometry of thick bulk samples, which are not transparent to an optical beam. This method has been applied to the measurement of the X-ray absorption,

The former is usually used to measure the dichroism. Magnetic thin multilayers have recently become important for information mass storage devices, and these materials are characterized with microbeam XMCD X-rays.

The coordination structure around the metal ion is analyzed by the EXAFS method. When a powder is measured by the XFY and TEY methods on a substrate, then the depth-selective chemical state analysis of a fine particle can be performed. Fly ash is a powder of micrometer-sized particles, which are a source of acid rain when they are dispersed in the air. The particles are put on an aluminum foil and irradiated by monochromated X-rays, and XANES spectra are measured by TEY and XFY methods.The surface catalyst process could be elucidated by the analysis of EXAFS spectra. The incident X-ray polarization dependence is an important parameter for the determination of the geometry of a reactant and the surface.Transition metals are usually a target of XAFS analysis, the energy range of which is from 5 to 20 keV. The beamline for X-rays of this energy range uses Be and polymer films as windows to separate the vacuum system from the atmosphere. Both lower and higher energy XAFS experiments require different techniques.Soft X-ray XAFS experiments, ranging from 0.1 to 5 keV, require UHV techniques. This is because any windows between the SR storage ring and the sample heavily absorb X-rays, hence a windowless beamline is required. Consequently, the sample chamber is made of UHV components and must be baked out up to 200 °C. The contaminants in X-ray windows and other X-ray optics are carbon and oxygen, which are in the soft X-ray region (250 -600 eV). Hence a windowless system is appropriate for the analysis of these elements. The shortcoming of the soft X-ray region experiment is the UHV system, because samples requiring X-ray absorption analysis could not always be inserted into the UHV system because they would emit gas into the clean system. A vacuum of 10 2 Pa is sufficient to avoid the absorption of X-rays in the X-ray path. The XAFS spectra of this soft X-ray region are surface sensitive and the profile changes of the spectra due to chemical state are very large. The spectra measured can be used for the same purpose (chemical state analysis) as XPS or ESCA. The detection limit of XAFS is usually lower than that of ESCA, hence XAFS has an advantage over ESCA if SR is available.XAFS experiments higher than 20 keV require different experimental techniques. The number of application examples is not large, mainly because high-energy X-ray sources are limited without using third-generation SR facilities. In place of measuring this energy range K-edge XAFS, the L-edge XAFS, the energy of which usually falls in the range 5 -20 keV, is measured. The L XAFS spectra are composed of L 1 , L 2 and L 3 edge jumps, which interfere with each other. To avoid this, the K edge is useful for the analysis. The lifetime of the K hole state of high-energy K-edge XAFS of higher atomic number elements is, however, shorter than the long-wavelength region. Because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the line widths of the absorption spectral components are as large as 100 eV. Both the EXAFS oscillation and XANES lose fine structure owing to this lifetime broadening. High-energy XAFS has recently been measured with the development of third-generation SR facilities, because the numerical analysis overcomes the short lifetime effect.

SOURCES AND DATABASES:
Academic societies and E-mail lists discuss the standardization of X-ray absorption spectrometry. As XAFS is used in many areas of research, standardization has been required. To achieve standardization, the International XAFS Society (IXS) was established in the 1990s. The purpose of the IXS is stated as follows:The International XAFS Society represents all those working on the fine structure associated with inner-shell excitation (near-edge and extended) by various probes (e.g. X-rays and electrons), and related techniques for which the data are interpreted on the same physical basis. The purpose of the IXS is to oversee activities which benefit the community as a whole, to establish operational committees, to provide for education in the field, to disseminate relevant information, to work with other related regional, national and professional organizations in promoting and developing XAS and related disciplines, and to act as representative for the community to other professional organizations.This society has a close relation to the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr). The WWW home page of the IXS is at Illinois Institute of Technology,Many kinds of activity reports published by SR facilities are useful sources of experimental methods and standard spectra.

Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy:
An electron beam, with an energy from a few hundred electron-volts to a few hundred kiloelectron-volts, impinges on a sample and loses its kinetic energy. When the sample is a bulk material, reflected electron energy is measured. Usually the loss of transmitted electron energy is measured for thin-film samples less than a few micrometers or a few tens of nanometers thick. This is called EELS. 132 EELS is usually combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electron energy loss structure is similar to the XAFS. The EXAFS region in EELS is called the extended electron energy loss fine structure (EXELFS). Forward-scattered (0 °) electron energy loss spectra, formed when electrons are transmitted in a thin film, are approximately equivalent to the optical spectra; the selection rule is the electric dipole. Energy loss spectra of electrons scattered at a large angle are not treated by the electric dipole transition, and sometimes include optically forbidden transitions. The transmission method used in TEM has a very high spatial resolution, hence chemical state imaging by the chemical shift of the absorption edge is possible. 133,134 High energy resolution and high spatial resolution are not always achieved by a single instrument. The EELS spectra are sensitive for low atomic number elements such as boron and carbon. It is not easy to measure the XAFS spectra of these long wavelengths using an SR facility.

Self-absorption:
Although the characteristic X-ray wavelength of an element is usually separated from the absorption edge wavelength of the same element for hard X-rays, they are very close to each other for the soft X-ray region. These close lines are, for example, transition metal La,b X-ray emission lines and L 2,3 absorption edges. The La and Lb X-ray emission lines emitted in a deep location in a solid are absorbed during the travel in the solid. Hence the X-ray emission spectra have dips due to the X-ray absorption spectra. The profiles of the La,b X-ray emission lines of transition metals excited by different electron energies (3 and 16 keV) change because of the self-absorption effect.

Extended X-ray Emission Fine Structure:
The radiative Auger effect (RAE) is always associated with the X-ray characteristic lines and this effect is an energy loss structure in characteristic X-ray emission, as shown in Figure

X-ray Raman Scattering:
X-ray Raman scattering is the effect of energy loss on X-ray scattering. Raman scattering is a similar physical process to Compton scattering. The difference is that Raman scattering involves scattering by core electrons whereas Compton scattering involves scattering 8265 Energy (eV) Intensity Rayleigh Raman Compton ×10 0 7765 500 θ = 60°F igure 38 Rayleigh, Compton, and Raman scattering spectra of 8265-eV incident X-rays by graphite observed at q D 60°.(Reproduced by permission from Tohji and Udagawa. 138 © 1987 The American Physical Society.) by conduction band electrons. X-ray Raman scattering is a method for measuring soft X-ray absorption spectra (say of carbon) with a hard X-ray spectrometer (a few kiloelectron-volts). Hard X-rays can be measured in air; soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which usually requires UHV, is possible in air by this method. Hard Xrays (8265 eV) impinge on a carbon-containing sample, and the X-rays lose energy by the carbon K edge due to the Raman scattering (ca. 300 eV), as shown in Figure

b-Environment Fine Structure:
The b-electron emission process in a nuclear conversion process suffers interference by the crystal structure for the same reason as EXAFS. This method is called BEFS. 140

Inverse Photoemission Spectroscopy:
IPES is an alternative method to measure the unoccupied electronic structure by irradiating electrons and detecting photons.

CONCLUSION:
X-ray absorption spectroscopy is chiefly used in the area of electronic structure study and structural analysis for the study of new materials, surfaces, and catalysts. The spectra measured are surface sensitive or bulk sensitive depending on the detection method. Chemical shift and profile changes are observable. Thus the spectral analysis is useful for materials characterization. This method is also powerful for analyzing mixed chemical states in industrial, environmental, and biological analytes. The development of SR facilities will make it possible to measure nanometer-sized samples in less than a few milliseconds.
