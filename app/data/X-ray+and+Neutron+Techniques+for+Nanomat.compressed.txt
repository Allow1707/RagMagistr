Introduction:
X-ray imaging and assessment of bone have been intimately linked already since the discovery of X-rays. Actually, the first application of X-rays was visualisation of bone on the organ levelThe trend in μCT and other X-ray microscopy techniques has been to go towards higher and higher resolutionOsteoporosis and other bone fragility-related diseases are not yet fully understood and are thus the subject of active research. While previously the main focus was the characterisation, description and diagnosis of these diseases, currently the main aim is to uncover the mechanisms behind bone loss and those involved in bone failure. Bone mass is the most important determinant of bone strength, but it is known not to be the only factor. For example, collagen cross-linking is thought to be important for the integrity of the bone tissueBone remodelling is achieved via the processes of mechanosensation and mechanotransduction, which are thought to be performed by the osteocyte system. Osteocytes are the most abundant bone cells dispersed throughout the bone system. They differentiate from osteoblasts, which are the cells responsible for bone formation, by getting trapped in the pre-bone matrix during tissue formation. The osteocytes interconnect and communicate through dendritic processesOsteocytes and the LCN are not the only aspects of bone ultrastructure that are interesting to study, however. At the ultrastructural level, bone tissue is a natural nanocomposite consisting of mineralised collagen fibres. These fibres are organised in a regular fashion around the vessel canals: the Haversian canals forming the centre in units of bone remodelling called osteons and Volkmann canals interconnecting the Haversian canals and the periosteum. During the lifetime of bone tissue, mineralised matrix is being resorbed by osteoclasts and replaced by osteoblasts with new osteons. Between these secondary osteons, there remain rests of older tissue called interstitial tissue. At the boundary of each osteon, there is a layer of mineralised tissue called the cement line, which is thought to have an important role in limiting crack propagation and to affect the overall stiffness of boneThe organisation of the collagen fibrils is thought to directly influence bone strength and toughness. The analysis of collagen orientation has so far been performed mainly in 2D using scanning electron microscopyThe techniques used to image bone ultrastructure in 3D have so far been transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). CLSM is however limited by the depth of penetration in mineralised tissue, and its spatial resolution is anisotropic, depending on the depth into the sample where the focus is placed. It is also a scanning technique, which implies that data acquisition is relatively slow. Finally, advanced staining and sample preparation is necessaryAnother technique which has recently been progressing towards chemical imaging of bone ultrastructure is infrared nanoscopy. Even though this technique gives only access to the chemical properties in 2D, it might be of increasing interest due to the increasing number of available instruments, relatively simple sample preparation and high spatial resolution up to tens of nm at a field of view in the order of 100 Â 100 μmSerial sectioning using a focused ion beam followed by imaging with scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) to image the lacuno-canalicular network has been reportedWe review here the work that has been done in imaging of the ultrastructure of bone in 3D using X-rays. We give a brief introduction to high-resolution X-ray imaging physics. We then continue to describe the different imaging methods that have been used for ultrastructural imaging in bone, along with the results that were obtained. We give particular attention to the propagation-based technique, where we outline more in detail the image formation and reconstruction. We then describe the type of analyses that have so far been possible at shorter length scales than can be seen by visible light. Finally, we briefly discuss what we consider the next step of 3D ultrastructure imaging in bone: the possibility of in situ cell imaging in bone using X-ray phase nano-tomography.

X-Ray Source:
The work described in Sects. 5.1.3, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 was performed on beamline ID22 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France. ID22 is located on a high-β straight section and was equipped with two insertion devices: an in-vacuum U23 and a revolver U35/U19. The electron beam in the synchrotron had a current of ~200 mA, an energy of 6 GeV and a relative energy spread of 0.001. The vertical (horizontal) emittance, β values and dispersion were 39 pm (3.9 nm), 3 m (37.2 m) and 0 m (0.137 m), respectively. The revolver device was chosen to give maximum photon output in a moderately narrow energy range centred on 17.5 keV, which is the principal working energy for imaging at ID22

Image Formation:
The refractive index n of an object can be described aswhere δ is the refractive index decrement, related to the phase shift of the incident wave after passing through the sample, and β is the absorption index, related to the attenuation of the incident beam induced by the sample. The refractive index decrement δ and the absorption index β can be respectively expressed as(1:3)where r c denotes the classical electron radius, λ the wavelength of the X-ray beam, ρ e the electron density, c the light velocity, f j the number of electrons per atom with damping constant γ j and Z the atomic number that corresponds to the total number of electrons per atom. Here, j corresponds to an electron in the atom.The absorption index β is related to the attenuation coefficient μ by the following relationshipÞdz:(1:4)The attenuation B and phase shift φ induced by the object can be described as projections parallel to the propagation direction (here, the z-axis). Note that x represents the vector (x, y).andÞdz:(1:6)At each angle θ, the interaction between the object and the X-ray wave can be described as a transmittance function:Thus, if u inc (x) denotes the incident wave front and u 0 (x) the wave front right after the sample (i.e. for a null propagation distance), we obtainThe corresponding intensity recorded by the detector, without any propagation, is(1:10)(1:11)(1:12)The free-space propagation over a distance D can be modelled by the Fresnel transform involving the propagator P Dand its Fourier transform:(1:(1:15) in the spatial domain, which corresponds toin the Fourier domain.Since u D usually stays in the real domain, and the propagator is applied in the Fourier domain, we getThe operatoris called the Fresnel transform. If we assume flat illumination, the interaction between the incident wave front and the sample followed by free-space propagation over a distance D can be modelled byThe intensity recorded by the detector at a distance D is(1:20)In the Fourier domain, the intensity can be expressed asThus, images recorded by the detector are quantitatively related to the phase shift of the wave induced by the object. Holotomography consists in acquiring projections for a complete rotation of the sample, at different sample-to-detector distances. This enables to cover well the Fourier domain (the Fresnel transform can have zero crossing at certain distances).

Magnified Images Formation:
Since the beam is divergent, recording an image at sample-to-detector distance D also induces, apart from phase contrast, magnification of the projections and creates a spherical wave front (Fig.We obtain projections with different magnification by modifying the propagation distance. In practice, the detector and the focus point are fixed, i.e. D 1 þ D 2 is constant. It means that it is the sample that moves along a translation stage to get images with different magnifications. Note that the spherical wave Fresnel diffraction phenomenon can be seen as a plane-wave illumination problem at the defocusing distance D defined by(1:23)In the following, D denotes the defocusing distance and can be seen as an equivalent of the propagation distance that takes into account the magnification. Since the position of the focus and the detector are kept fixed, [D 1 , D 2 , D n , . . ., D N ] represents the equivalent propagation distance indexed by n, with N the total number of distances used. The incoming parallel X-ray beam (X) is focused onto a focal spot (F) using Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors, curved reflective optics that will horizontally and vertically focus the beam. D 1 represents the distance between the spot (F) and the sample (S). D 2 denotes the propagation distance, i.e. the distance between the sample and the detector

Contrast Transfer Function:
To retrieve the phase information from the image recorded by the detector (which is a non-linear problem), and since we are in the Fresnel diffraction regime, we can use the contrast transfer function (CTF) model. This linear model, which expresses the intensity as a linear function of the absorption and the refractive index decrement, is valid for slowly varying phase and weakly absorbing objects. These two conditions can be mathematically written asfor slowly varying phase andfor weak absorption.The CTF is based on the linearisation of the transmittance function to the first order:By substituting the linearisation of the transmittance function in Eq. 1.21 and keeping only the first-order terms, we get the CTF:(1:27)Where ~denotes the Fourier transform and δ Delta the Dirac delta function.Nevertheless, for nano-tomography, the propagation distances are relatively long compared to the pixel size and wavelength. This means the condition in Eq. 1.24 and thus the linearisation in Eq. 1.26 are no longer valid, so that the non-linear contribution of the phase cannot be neglectedThe CTF can be rewritten to take this into account:(1:28)where ĨNL;D f ð Þ represents the non-linear contribution. Phase retrieval is thus performed in two stages. An initial guess of the phase is determined using a classical linear least square minimisation using the CTF, described in Sect.

Phase Retrieval with the CTF:
To retrieve the phase using the CTF, linear least square optimisation is used. This method is usually used to solve an overdetermined problem, for example, a problem containing one unknown and N equations, as it is the case here, since we recorded images at N distances (that constitute our N equations) and want to determine one unknown, the phase.Consider the following overdetermined problem:where n is an integer so that n 1 : N ½ , x is the unknown, y n denotes one of the N measurements and A n is the linear transformation applied to x to get y n . The linear least square method determines an estimate of x, x, so thatA n y n :(1:30)Solving CTF (Eq. 1.27) is equivalent to minimiseHere, Tikhonov regularisation is used to solve this minimisation problem(1:32)with(1:35)Once the projections are well conditioned, phase retrieval is performed according to the scheme presented above. A linear least square method is performed to assess roughly the phase and a non-linear conjugate gradient method to refine it. The obtained phase projections are eventually used as an input of a tomographic reconstruction algorithm (here, the filtered back projection method) to get a volume of the refractive index decrement.

Ptychographic Tomography:
One way to achieve high-resolution imaging with X-rays is to exploit diffraction. This requires the use of a pencil beam, either by using a pinhole or X-ray focusing optics. An image is then recorded at a relatively long distance downstream of the object, which corresponds to far-field or Fraunhofer diffraction. Images recorded in this way will contain information closely related to the squared modulus of the Fourier transform of the imaged object, convolved with the Fourier transform of the incident beam. It is in certain cases possible to reconstruct the object transmission function by the use of iterative phase retrieval algorithms based on projections onto setsThe small support requirement can be obviated by scanning the probe across an extended sample while letting the probe position overlap at each image position (in practice the sample is scanned through the beam). By using an iterative reconstruction scheme, a complete phase projection can be reconstructedSince the phase shift introduced by the object in the X-ray beam can be considered as a straight-line projection, if we have access to the phase shift, we can use it to reconstruct the 3D refractive index decrement distribution in the sample, in analogy to the classical attenuation case. What is particularly attractive with this is that for hard X-rays, the refractive index decrement is proportional to the local mass density in the samplePtychographic tomography has been used to image bone ultrastructureFigureThe major strength of ptychographic tomography is that it is capable of attaining very high resolutions without the use of X-ray optics. Isotropic 3D resolutions up to 16 nm have been reported

Transmission X-Ray Microscopy (TXM):
Magnification on the X-ray side can be achieved by the implementation of a transmission X-ray microscope, analogously to what can be done with visible light. Due to the weak refraction of X-rays, diffractive optics, so-called Fresnel zone plates, are used for this purpose. A full-field TXM implementation has been reported by Andrews et al.The reported TXM setup was used to image the LCN. Part of one lacuna and its environing canaliculi were imaged in trabecular bone. The sample was extracted from the proximal region of a mouse tibia by microtome cutting, followed by washing with a saline jet to remove marrow. It was then dried and attached to a steel cannula tip with epoxy for imaging. The resulting sample consisted of a single trabecula and was less than 50 μm thick, which is approximately the depth of focus of the TXM. The sample was stained with 1 % uranyl acetate for 12 h to improve contrast. The lacuna and canaliculi are well resolved in the image, but are fairly weakly contrasted (Fig.A TXM images the attenuation of the sample, i.e. the same contrast as in standard X-ray μCT. An advantage of TXM is that it can achieve high spatial resolution without the need for advanced image reconstruction. The disadvantages seem to be the demanding sample preparation and the limited sample size due to the short depth of field, approximately 50 μm. The technique also requires fairly low energies, thereby limiting the thickness of the samples that can be traversed. The lower energy also increases the X-ray dose deposited in the sample, thus increasing the risk of radiation damage.

In-line Phase Tomography:
It is possible to implement a transmission projection microscope by the use of X-ray optics to focus the beam and placing the sample after the focus in the resulting divergent beam. This kind of microscope has been implemented using Kirkpatrick-Baez reflective opticsThe phase can be retrieved at each projection angle by a process known as phase retrieval. Several algorithms for phase retrieval from Fresnel diffraction patterns have been developed. Most of them are based on linearisation of the squared modulus of the Fresnel transform to achieve efficient, filtering-based solutionsIn-line phase tomography has been used to image several ultrastructural features in boneIn-line phase tomography has some aspects that make it attractive for bone imaging. It is a full-field imaging technique, which means that the image acquisition is relatively fast. Acquisition time of ~4 h per sample has been reportedThe in-line technique currently has one disadvantage in common with ptychographic tomography, however. Image reconstruction is not straightforward, since it relies on advanced reconstruction algorithms that presently require considerable expertise to operate. A disadvantage compared to ptychography is currently the achievable spatial resolution. While no measurement has been reported, by inspection of the reconstructed volumes, the spatial resolution so far achieved seems to be ~200 nm (FWHM at interfaces in the reconstructed 3D object). With these advantages and disadvantages taken together, in-line phase tomography seems to be an appropriate method for quantitative studies and study of ultrastructural features in addition to the LCN.

Collagen Orientation:
Three-dimensional images acquired by means of in-line phase tomography allow to explore the details of the submicron-scale architecture of bone. In particular, the structure of bone lamellae can be analysed in unprecedented detail. Lamellar pattern is the dominating arrangement of bone in the human skeleton and can be found most frequently in the form of osteons. Osteons are approximately 200 μm diameter cylindrical structural units constituted by concentrically arranged lamellae surrounding the central Haversian canal of 50-100 μm diameter hosting blood vessels and nerves. Lamellae are 3-7 μm thick layers that were characterised and defined originally on microscopy images of cut sections. The reason for the appearance of lamellae was already more than hundred years ago proposed to be the ultrastructure, namely, the orientation of the collagen-mineral compositeOne interesting question has beenand still isif the lamellar structure is the result of a collagen self-assembly processesWith respect to the role of ultrastructure in mechanical properties of lamellar bone, besides numerous other studies, the works of Ascenzi and colleagues have to be mentioned. These authors extensively researched and reported the potential relationships between the osteonal types classified based on appearance under confocal microscopy and mechanical properties of isolated osteonsIn-line phase tomography provides the density contrast and spatial resolution that are sufficient to investigate and quantitatively describe this complex arrangement in three dimensions.As pointed out in Sect. 5.1.3, the characteristic arcing pattern apparent in Fig.Using this technique, we confirmed that mineralised collagen fibrils in lamellar bone are organised into a plywood structure that is made of parallel quasi-planes in which the fibrils have unidirectional alignment. Within the largest analysed region, having an in-lamellar-plane dimension of approximately 30 Â 70 μm, the standard deviation of the quantified fibril orientation was as small as five degrees. The evolution of fibril orientation across lamellae was dominated by smooth transitions; discrete changes were rare. We found two major plywood pattern types. The first one resembled the rotating plywood described earlierWe found twisting and oscillating plywood patterns to coexist within the same osteon in a consecutive manner. Close to the external boundary of the osteon, i.e. at the cement line, we observed in all investigated cases twisting plywood arrangement. The lamellar structure of osteons was hypothesised to have importance mechanically by acting as an efficient crack arresting boundary and thus protect the vessels and nerves within the central canalAs a qualitative validation of our approach, in a selected analysis region, the computed orientation was used to construct a virtual 3D fibril model that compared well with the corresponding sub-volume of the original greyscale image, and, in particular, the arch pattern could be reproduced (Fig.Apart from the plywood-type arrangements, we could observe rather disorganised regionsIn summary, our results not only corroborated findings of earlier studies, but provided novel insight into the lamellar microstructure in bone. Further, a unique set of quantitative results could be derived from nanoscale three-dimensional data and allowed reinterpretation of previous observations. Moreover, our findings were in line with the results of the concurrent, but independently performed, studies of Reznikov et al. investigating lamellar arrangement in various species by means of FIB-SEMNevertheless, the analysis method developed and applied inMost of these limitations can be overcome by employing a truly 3D approach. The lamellar arrangement consists of planes with unidirectional fibrils, orientation of which changes relatively rapidly across the lamellae. This direction-dependent rate of the orientation change requires the analysis method to be well tuned to this structure. The updated analysis protocol has two steps. In the first one, the rough lamellar orientation is assessed, which is used in a second step to align the rectangular analysis volume. The size of the latter, to be in accordance with the above discussed closely transversely isotropic orientation change rate, is larger in the lamellar plane than out of this plane. The capabilities of this approach are illustrated in Fig.A rather general limitation of all high-resolution methods is the strong sampling effect due to the available field of view. This effect can be compensated by scanning multiple regions of the same sample and/or increasing the number of specimens to strengthen statistical power. The expected improvements in imaging technology should provide the basis for larger, even clinically relevant studies. However, the relatively low accessibility of the infrastructure remains a challenge. In this respect, the role of coarser-scale methods that are sensitive to the alteration of the lamellar structure or the fluctuations of its mechanical properties has to be emphasised. More easily accessible laboratory techniques such as scanning acoustic microscopy

Morphology and FE Modelling of the Lacuno-Canalicular Network:
Porosity of bone is at least as important as the mineralised tissue matrix itself, both biologically and mechanically. On the micro-scale of cortical bone, one finds the pore network of osteocytes that consists of the lacunae hosting the cell bodies and the canaliculi, which are tiny tunnels connecting lacunae of neighbouring cellsOsteocyte lacunae are ellipsoidal-shaped voids in the bone matrix with approximate sizes of 5 μm Â 10 μm Â 20 μm and can therefore be resolved with laboratory devices such as confocal microscopy and desktop μCTThe connection between lacunae provided by the canalicular network is essential due to several reasons. Osteocyte dendrites can extend in these tunnels and connect to the neighbouring cell via gap junctions, allowing for direct communicationNevertheless, the remodelling process is driven also by mechanical signals to which these cells are also sensitiveAn unresolved issue with respect to both previous theories is the order of magnitude difference between the strains available in vivo (few thousand microstrains)The repertoire of the available appropriate experimental tools is very restricted; the available data is limited and shows high deviations for certain quantitative descriptors of the LCNHigher-resolution imaging can be achieved by means of the FIB-SEM approachIn that study, the in-line phase tomography protocol described above (Sect. 5.1.3) was used to image cylindrical samples of human femoral cortical bone. Sample preparation was challenging since cylindrical samples with diameter less than 700 μm had to be prepared from several specimens within a relatively short time and with reasonable costs. We used a precision lathe for this purpose. First, a few mm wide and deep and approximately 15-20 mm long rods were cut, by means of a diamond-coated wheel saw, from a prescribed location of the femoral cortical cross sections. These samples were then mounted on the lathe using custom-built holders, and the required sample diameter was achieved by careful turning. This protocol allowed to preserve the close to native state of the samples. However, the resulting bone cylinders had to be dried prior to scanning to avoid potential sample motion during image acquisition.Imaging provided us with an overview image with 715 μm field of view containing the entire cross section of the cylinders with 350 nm voxel size and a high-resolution image of selected regions with 102 μm field of view and 50 nm voxel size. Rectangular volumes of interest (VOIs) were selected from the high-resolution images to analyse the LCN and deformations of osteocytes. Each VOI contained a single lacuna with its canaliculi (Fig.First, the geometry of the pores was identified using specialised segmentation methods including thresholding, morphological operations and a custom-developed connectivity enhancement algorithm. The latter was required to correct the effects of ring artefacts artificially cutting some canaliculi. In each VOI, the lacuna was then separated from the canaliculi, and several morphological parameters of both pore compartments were quantified (Fig.In-line phase tomography imaging provided unprecedented details of the LCN (Fig.The main outcome of the finite element analysis was that the magnitude of the strains at the junctions of the osteocyte cell body and dendrites reached up to 70 times the externally applied deformations and further local peaks were observed in the dendrites (Fig.However, these high strains were localised in a very small portion on the cell volume. There was no evident relation between the cell deformation and the parameters of the LCN morphology of the investigated osteocytes. One of the derived deformation-related parameters, the relative dendrite volume in which the strain amplification was higher than tenfold, was similar in the VOIs originating from the same bone sampleand practically the same osteonin two out of three cases. This suggests that local tissue age, even if not considering the related increase in the mineralisation and consequently in the stiffness of the extracellular matrix, may have an impact on osteocyte deformations.Our analyses were limited by the number of investigated osteocytes. Future studies should therefore include several samples from numerous donors so that appropriate statistical analyses can be performed. The automated analysis protocol presented inA further main limitation was the fact that the cells were not visible in the nano-CT images and thus had to be reconstructed artificially using literature-based data and a priori assumptions. However, recent advances in imaging technology are providing very high contrast and spatial resolution. This contrast may provide the possibility of imaging not only the mineralised matrix but also the cell itself in situ. Promising results in this respect have been achieved by means of both ptychography and in-line phase tomography. Moreover, the ultra-high resolution of these methods may allow to examine unprecedented details of osteocytes and their connection to the mineralised wall. Particularly interesting in this respect would be the focal adhesions of the cell dendrites to the canalicular wallDirect straining is just one of the potential theories for mechanical stimulation of osteocytes. Fluid flow-induced stimuli may indeed be of key importance in this respect. The potential of this theory, demonstrated analytically

Mineralisation on the Nanoscale:
Phase-contrast-based X-ray imaging techniques at the nanoscale allow to gain new insight into mineral exchange at the interface between the osteocyte network and the surrounding mineralised matrix for human bone tissue. The findings summarised in this section suggest that spatial distribution of bone tissue mass density is determined by the canalicular network morphology. Bone is a biological material structured hierarchically over several length scales, from the molecular level of collagen to the organ levelIn bone remodelling, maturation of the newly formed osteonal bone tissue is associated with a rapid primary increase in mineralisation followed by a slower secondary phase. This increase in mineralisation requires supply and precipitation of minerals into the bone matrix. Mineral delivery can occur only from the extracellular fluid via interfaces such as the Haversian system and the osteocyte pore network.After the process of rapid initial mineralisation, a secondary mineralisation process takes place, which adds about 10 % more mineral over a period of several yearsIt is believed that the calcium concentration in the ECF is controlled mainly by the parathyroid hormone (PTH)The role of non-collagenous proteins in regulating the mineralisation process is of great interest in literatureCrystal growth and crystal dissolution occur through equilibrium processes at the surfaces and potentially explain the stability of the calcium supply demanded by all kinds of physiological processesThe role of the osteocyte, of which there are as many as tens of thousands per cubic millimetre of boneThe distribution of osteocytes and their dendrites is thus not only crucial for proper sensing of mechanical signals across the bone matrix but also for easy access to mineral reservoirs. The distance between the extracellular tissue and the LCN is therefore of particular importance and has recently been demonstrated to be strongly related to the thickness and orientation of mineral particles and thus tissue qualityIn a recent studyThe results indicated that mass density gradients diminished with increasing tissue age, resulting in a higher and a more homogeneously distributed extracellular matrix mass density in old tissue. These findings supported our hypothesis that extracellular matrix mineralisation is achieved through the diffusion of calcium from the extracellular fluid contained in the LCN to the bone matrix through all interfaces including the canaliculi. The smaller mass density values and gradients found in the peri-canalicular tissue compared to the peri-lacunar regions can be explained by the morphology of the LCN, indicating a higher mineral flux at the lacunar interfaces. We estimated that the amount of calcium stored in the subdomain of the bone tissue located within 0.5 μm distance from the LCN greatly exceeds the amount required for a rapidly exchangeable calcium pool to be used to compensate daily fluctuations in the serum calcium level. However, further studies are needed to confirm a mineral flux from the mineralised matrix into the LCN. Supporting the important role of this micropore network, we quantified the surface density (pore wall surface normalised to bone volume) of the LCN to be about 20 times higher than the surface density of the Haversian system. This relation holds despite the volume ratio of the lacunae being approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that of the Haversian canals.In line with recent studies, these findings underlined the importance of the entire LCN in mineral homeostasis and the influence of its morphology on the spatial distribution of mass density in the mineralised extracellular matrix of bone. The role of the increased mass density adjacent to this pore network should therefore be taken into account in drug deposition studies and mechanical models studying the mechanosensation of osteocytes. Future studies using synchrotron radiation phasecontrast nano-computed tomography are expected to further aid the investigation of the diffusion and mineralisation processes and their coordination via osteocytes or other factors.
Instrumentation:
The work on in-line phase nano-CT shown here was performed on beamline ID22 at the ESRF. This beamline has now moved to the ID16 section and is run as a two two-branch nano-imaging (ID16A) and nano-analysis (ID16B) beamline. The ID16A end station is located at 185 m from the source and is mainly dedicated to problems in biology, biomedicine and nanotechnology. It is optimised for highresolution quantitative 3D imaging techniques with a specific focus on X-ray fluorescence and projection microscopy. This branch will be optimised for ultimate hard X-ray focusing of the beam (<20 nm) at specific energies (17 and 33.6 keV, ΔE/E ~10 À2 ). The beamline uses fixed curvature multilayer coated KB optics. 3D nano-positioning is done using a metrologic reference under control of capacitive sensors and an on-line video microscope for sample placement. One main difference to the previous imaging implementation is that samples are imaged in a vacuum environment. In the future, cryo-cooling capabilities will be added to increase the scope for imaging in life science. The ID16B end station, in parallel operation, is located at approximately 165 m from the source and is optimised for high-resolution (50 nm to 1 μm) spectroscopic applications (ΔE/E ~10 À4 ), including X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray-excited optical luminescence. It offers a multimodal approach (XAS, XRD, XRI) capable of in situ experiments. In a complementary way to the ID16A end station, ID16B will provide a monochromatic beam tuneable over a large energy range

Bone Nano-imaging:
The above described technological advancements are expected to provide further insights into the structure and function of bone on the submicron scale. An important issue to be addressed here is the detailed morphology of canaliculi and in particular the interface of the osteocyte dendrites and the mineralised extracellular tissue. Moreover, the geometries of both the osteocytes and its pericellular space filled with interstitial fluid are of high interest. These details should provide the basis for image analysis and finite element methods aiming at unravelling the not yet fully understood mechanosensation of these cells. The interaction of osteocytes with the mineralised matrix, in the context of both remodelling and mineral homoeostasis, could be more efficiently analysed with even higher-resolution imaging. Bone tissue structure, density and composition at the direct vicinity of the cells are of highest interest in this respect. Even more accurate and detailed data on collagen orientation also around the LCN porosity would allow for better description of the mechanical properties of bone at these fine scales. Besides the topic of microcrack formation, more exact description of the deformations arriving to the cell through the heterogeneous and anisotropic bone tissue could be better analysed in possession of the higher-resolution image data. Due to the high sensitivity of in-line phase tomography, it should also be possible to image the osteocytes directly in situ. We have some indication that there is enough contrast to do this (Fig.Recently a relatively new approach has been developed that combines synchrotronbased scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM)Over the last two decades third-generation synchrotrons were built worldwide, providing access for scientists from various scientific fields. Modern, thirdgeneration synchrotron light sources generate X-rays with high intensity that, depending on the technique, can be monochromated and focused to narrow spot sizes. Synchrotron radiation stretches across the electromagnetic spectrum from infrared light to hard X-rays. It is generated by deflecting the beam path of relativistic electrons in the storage ring of a synchrotron either by bending magnets or by insertion devices such as wigglers or undulators. Bending magnets are strong dipole magnets in arced sections in the storage ring, deflecting and changing the direction of the electron beam in the storage ring. Synchrotron radiation is produced in a fan tangentially to each bending magnet (BM). In contrast, wigglers and undulators (ID) are located in straight sections of a storage ring. Their physical properties -gap, phase, and magnetic field strength -are tunable to produce synchrotron radiation with higher flux, higher brilliance and smaller divergence angles as compared to bending magnet radiation

STXM:
STXM is a spectromicroscopy approach that combines NEXAFS spectroscopy in the X-ray energy range between 100 and 2500 eV with imaging capabilities at 10-40 nm spatial resolutionPioneer STXM development was achieved by Kirz and Rarback back in the 1980sTableSTXM is used extensively to study structure and processes in material science, such as metal-insulator transitions in tunnel bronzes

STXM Spectro-tomography:
STXM in combination with tilt-series tomography allows for analyzing the chemical composition of samples in three dimensions (3D). Two-dimensional (2D) STXM spectromicroscopy is sometimes limited in its ability to associate structural features and compositional information due to lack of information about the distribution in the 3rd dimension along the X-ray beam axis. This ambiguity can be circumvented by analyzing the sample in 3D. This can be done in a variety of ways, including serial sectioningSoft X-ray STXM tomography was implemented for the first time by Haddad and colleaguesThe first real 3D chemical mapping (i.e. with multiple photon energies) with STXM was implemented using serial sectioning instead of tilt-series tomography. Imaging of serial sections of toner particles at multiple energies across the C 1s absorption edge allowed for a full 3D reconstruction of the chemical composition of these particlesWhereas analysis of biological or environmental samples was one of the driving forces for STXM spectro-tomography development, the technique has also established itself as a powerful tool in materials science. For example, STXM spectro-tomography was used to identify the internal structure of colloidal photonic (silicate) crystals at the S 1s absorption edgeA novel wet cell for the analysis of fully hydrated samples was developed in collaboration with Luxel (Luxel, Friday Harbor, USA). This wet cell was used for the first time to map intracellular sulfur globules and to identify their association with polysaccharides in a cell of the sulphur-metabolizing bacteria Allochromatium vinosum. Individual components were mapped in 3D at the C 1s and Ca 2p absorption edges, and complemented by a 2D analysis at the S 2p absorption edgeA hydrated sample from this study is used in Sect. 2.2 to illustrate methods for preparing wet cells for STXM spectro-tomography; the results of the study are discussed in Sect. 3.3. In addition to the dataset for the hydrated sample, the preparation of dry samples of another, photoautotrophic Fe(II)-oxidizing Rhodobacter ferrooxidans strain SW2 are shown in Sect. 2.2 and major findings are discussed in Sect. 3.1.

TXM:
TXM is also a synchrotron-based X-ray microscopy that employs soft (and hard) X-rays. There are two fundamental differences between TXM and STXM. Firstly, STXM is a point probe, raster-scanning technique that acquires data in a pixel-by-pixel mode, whereas TXM is a full-field technique that acquires images simultaneously, but usually with a rather restricted field of view in the range of 10 Â 10 μm 2 . Secondly, TXM requires imaging optics in addition to the condenser optics -in both cases zone plates can be used. Full-field TXM was first developed by Schmahl and Rudolf in the 1960sAlthough extensive discussion of TXM would be out of the scope of this chapter, a few special setups are mentioned here. A soft X-ray TXM spectro-tomography beamline with an outstanding energy resolution that allows for acquiring NEXAFS spectra with a spatial resolution down to 25 nm is installed at BESSY II (Berlin; Germany)TXM was developed with a strong focus on biological applications particularly by using the intrinsic X-ray absorption contrast of the samples and thus does not require any staining (e.g. using heavy metals) as is necessary for transmission electron microscopy and tomography. Early work on TXM tomography was performed at BESSY I (Berlin, Germany) on the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

Hard X-ray Tomography:
In contrast to soft X-ray spectro-microscopy, hard X-ray tomographic microscopy (XTM) is used to record 3D data of thicker samples, accompanied by chemical mapping of heavier elements. XTM cannot provide analytical information on soft matter consisting of light elements, but phase contrast imaging is used to visualize soft matter components. Different optical setups for XTM are available, such as reflective, refractive or diffractive optics, making XTM suitable for various applications for solid bulk samples, mostly in material science but also for addressing biological and environmental questions

Ptychography:
Ptychography is a coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) technique that uses an X-ray point probe created by KirkPatrick-Baez optics or Fresnel ZPs2 Instrumental and Experimental Methodology of STXM Spectro-tomography

Instrumentation:
STXM requires a synchrotron as soft X-ray source. A schematic of the spectromicroscopy beamline 10ID1 at the CLS is shown in Fig.Fresnel ZPs are radially symmetric diffractive optics with a central stop. The diameter and the width of the outermost zone of the ZP control the focal length at a given photon energy and spatial resolutionSoft X-ray photons are converted by a phosphor scintillator to visible light pulses, which are then detected by high-performance photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu R647P), or by various types of silicon or avalanche photodiodes in the different instruments. STXM can be operated under low (10 À3 torr) or high (10 À8 torr) vacuum, under atmospheric pressure or under He atmosphere. A partial atmosphere (1/6th to 1/3rd) of He is preferred since He is transparent for soft X-rays and is a good The rotation system mounted in the STXM kinematic mount. The ZP -OSA and sample-OSA distances have been increased for clarity. (c) Photograph of the process of mounting a grid strip on the tip of the tomo pin using the micrometer driven locking tweezer system described in the text thermal conductor, which allows rapid thermalization of the sample environment and cooling for stages and motors. However, vacuum is used for STXM applications where sample cooling or heating is required. The spectral resolving power of most STXM beamlines is E/ΔE > 3000 with a photon flux of 10 7 -10 9 s À1 .NEXAFS spectra are acquired by repeatedly scanning a sample with X-ray photon energies that are successively increased across an X-ray absorption edge. X-rays of certain energies are preferentially absorbed by the sample, resulting in excitation of core electrons to a higher unoccupied energy stateBeam-induced sample heating in STXM was measured to be <1 C

Cell Cultivation:
Studies of two kinds of Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria and cyanobacteria will be shown as examples of biological applications of STXM spectro-tomography. The first Fe(II)oxidizing bacterium is the photoferrotrophic, anaerobic Rhodobacter ferrooxidans strain SW2 that was isolated from a freshwater pond

Geomicrobiological Samples:
Samples for STXM spectro-tomography can be prepared in various ways. For specimens that are not much affected by drying artefacts, STXM spectrotomography samples can be prepared by wet deposition on a formvar-coated 300-mesh or 200-mesh copper TEM grid (Fig.With care, a range of non-eucentric motion less than 50 microns can be achieved. After gluing, the strip is released remotely, and upon settling of the glue, the rod with the mounted strip or the Luxel wet cell can be clamped onto the tomography rotation stage. This type of sample mounting on a formvar-coated 300-mesh copper TEM grid was used for the cell-mineral suspensions of the Fe(II)-oxidizing bacterial strain SW2 that is presented in Sect. 3.1. SW2 cell-mineral complexes were cultivated for 7 days as described in Sect. 2.2.1. Cell-mineral suspensions were sampled anoxically in a glove box (N 2 atmosphere) and washed twice with anoxic, sterile deionized (DI) water upon centrifugation to remove residual salts from the freshwater medium. A few droplets of the cell-mineral suspension were transferred onto a formvar-coated 300-mesh copper TEM grid, blotted and air dried under N 2 atmosphere (Fig.If hydrated samples are required, aqueous samples can be loaded into glass micro-capillaries of 150-200 nm wall thickness and a diameter of 3-5 μmBoth of these problems can be circumvented using wet cells for tomography produced by Luxel (Friday Harbor, USA). These consist of a 15 μm thick and 250 μm wide metal frame that is covered by 30 nm LUXFilm ® polyimide membranes on both sides

Material Samples:
As an example of a materials science application of STXM spectro-tomography we present results from a "standard" sample used to develop a variety of quantitative 3D mapping methods for applications to optimization of automotive hydrogen-based fuel cell electrode materials. The "standard" sample consists of the overlay of two thin polymer films with Pt-coated carbon fibres embedded in resin as one layer and Teflon TM fibres embedded in resin as the second layer. The bilayer sample was microtomed and mounted on a formvar-coated grid. A strip from this grid was then excised and mounted on the tomography stage, using methods described above. This approach provides a model system with appropriate spatial scales and relevant spatial correlations of the chemical components present in the electrodes of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEM-FC). The second materials science example is taken from the first STXM spectro-tomography experiments

Data Acquisition:
The sample (either glass micro-capillary, carbon nanopipette, or Luxel wet cell / TEM grid strip mounted onto brass rod) is clamped to the rotation stage for STXM spectrotomography measurements. The tomography stage is then mounted onto the piezo stage of the STXM. The rotation is software controlled. The maximum rotation angle above which the grid bars obscure the view is typically around AE72 for grid samples (Sect. 3.1); the Luxel wet cell samples (Sect. 3.3) allowed for AE80 rotation, whereas capillaries (Sect. 3.4) can be rotated by AE90 . The sample is rotated stepwise, typically in 4 steps, which is a compromise that allows for good-quality reconstruction and efficient data acquisition. Thus, an entire STXM spectro-tomography dataset consists of measurements at %37 different rotation angles. A time-efficient data collection approach that also limits radiation damage is to acquire datasets with a small number of selected photon energies that are specific for certain chemical species. For example, 288.2 eV, the peak of the C 1s ! π* peptide transition

Spatial Resolution and Quantitative Aspects of STXM:
Spectro-tomography As for other tilt-series tomography approaches, the spatial resolution in STXM spectro-tomography is anisotropic. The resolution in the direction parallel to the tilt axis is defined by the chosen pixel spacingSince rotation angles α of up to AE72 (% AE1.26 rad) were measured, the theoretical resolution d z is % 54 nm. Furthermore, the resolution will depend on the zone plate used, and on the X-ray energy of the measurements since the depth of field increases with increasing energy. A precise evaluation of the achieved resolution would require measurements on a three-dimensional test pattern, which have not yet been performed. However, based on the separation of small features in actual samples, spatial resolutions of at least 80 nmwhere OD(voxel x,y,z ) is the optical density of an individual voxel in the reconstructed 3D tomography dataset and OD(pixel x,y ) is the optical density of an individual pixel of the respective 2D species map at the rotation angle of 0 (Fig.

Pre-processing:
The transmission images acquired at a single rotation angle are aligned and converted to linear absorbance in optical density units OD = Àln(I/I 0 ), where I is the measured intensity of a pixel and I 0 is the incident flux measured in an empty area adjacent to the sample. Several software packages are available that provide tools for image alignment and conversion into OD units, such as aXis2000(http://unicorn.mcmaster.ca/aXis2000.html) or Mantis1. The first approach is to subtract an image acquired in the pre-edge region from an image acquired at a specific characteristic energy (described in Sect. 2.3). This approach is the quickest method, but its precision is limited by the specificity of the selected energies. Typically it works well for elemental maps or for chemical maps of compounds that have strong resonance absorption peaks such as the C 1s ! π* C=O transition of protein. 2. If more than two images were recorded across an absorption edge, the second approach, linear decomposition, can be used in combination with the spectra of known reference compoundsAll three approaches result in quantitative elemental/species maps that in some cases can be normalized to an effective thickness of the respective compound in nm. The chemical maps (on a relative or absolute thickness scale) at all rotation angles are then merged into a rotation stack for correct angle-to-angle alignment and subsequent 3D reconstruction (Fig.

For the examples presented in Sect. 3.1, quantitative maps were obtained for organic carbon at the C 1s absorption edge by using OD image difference, OD 288.2eV ÀOD 280eV for the SW2 and cyanobacteria examples. The same procedure was applied to obtain quantitative iron maps at the Fe 2p absorption edge for both the SW2 and the BoFeN1 examples, OD 723.3eV ÀOD 704eV . In this case, linear decomposition of the datasets was not possible at the C 1s and Fe 2p absorption edges for SW2 and at the Fe 2p absorption edge for BoFeN1 due to the high sample thickness and the associated spectral distortions due to absorption saturation (OD > 2)Quantitative maps of SW2 at the O 1s absorption edge were obtained by fitting the image stacks across the O 1s edge with reference spectra of proteinIn the previously mentioned examples, the data of all absorption edges were handled individually, and thus, an alignment of the volume files resulting from the reconstruction is necessary (see Sect. 2.4.2). This can be circumvented by merging the images at all X-ray energies and edges per rotation angle into the same stack file for a first alignment (Fig.

3D Reconstruction:
A number of software tools for 3D tomographic reconstruction were developed by various groups around the world in the last decade, mostly for transmission electron tomography. Several of them turned out to be useful and compatible with the image quality provided by STXM tilt-series spectro-tomography. Two very powerful packages are IMODVarious types of noise affect the quality of the reconstructed 3D volumes. Two main sources are real background (non-specific) absorption signal and streaking artefacts that are caused by the rather coarse angle step-size that we use as a compromise for efficiency and to reduce beam damage, and by the missing wedge effect

Biological: Dry Chemical Mapping:
Fe-(oxyhydr)oxides represent some of the most important scavengers for other metal ions such as heavy metals in polluted environments. Often these minerals are of biogenic origin and associated with organic matter. Thus, understanding the influence of microbial Fe(II)-oxidation and subsequent precipitation of Fe(III) minerals is essential to comprehend the fate of heavy metals or pollutants in the environment. The photoferrotrophic, anaerobic Rhodobacter ferrooxidans strain SW2 was used as a model organism to study bacterial Fe(II)-oxidation and subsequent cell-(iron)mineral aggregate formation. SW2 cells are loosely associated with biogenic iron minerals that are not subject to cellular modification, in contrast to the nitrate-reducing, anaerobic Acidovorax sp. strain BoFeN1 (see Sect. 3.3) that precipitates dense shells of organic-associated iron minerals around the cells. STXM spectro-tomography studies of SW2 revealed evidence for several mechanisms of Fe-sorption and precipitation. SW2 cells were air dried onto formvar-coated TEM grids. Grid strips were sliced, mounted onto a tomography stage and analyzed by chemical tomography at the C 1s, O 1s and Fe 2p absorption edges, as described previously. FigureIn another study, the quantitative analysis of chemical tomography datasets at the C 1s and the Ca 2p absorption edges resulted in a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of calcium carbonate precipitation by planktonic cyanobacteriaÀ as carbon source. The latter process results in a significant pH increase. In aqueous systems where Ca 2+ ions are present this can result in a significant supersaturation with respect to the calcium carbonates calcite, aragonite and vaterite, where calcite is the thermodynamically most stable form. Cyanobacteria are known to cause massive precipitation events in lakes, so-called whitings. However, the precipitation of stable mineral phases attached to the cell would not be beneficial for planktonic cyanobacteria as the cells would lose their buoyancy and precipitate out of the photic zone. Therefore the cells developed a protection mechanism that prevents the formation of stable mineral phases that are attached to the cells. The quantitative 3D analysis of the correlation between the concentrations of calcium and organic carbon in this sample revealed the presence of two different types of EPS with different sorption capacities for the Ca 2+ -cation. At the time of the study, manual segmentation of the 3D dataset showed the spatial distribution of the two EPS layers around a single cyanobacterium and the presence of two critical nuclei of calcite on the cell surface (Fig.

Polymer: Dry Chemical Mapping:
Polymer-electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEM-FC) operating at low temperature (50-80 C) with pure H 2 as fuel are being developed by many car manufacturers for near-term implementation in mass-produced automobiles, as a means of reducing carbon emissions. While the automotive performance of present devices is similar to that of gasoline-powered cars, there is a cost premium and some concerns about reliability. Research is focused on reducing the amount of Pt catalyst in the electrodes and making the systems less susceptible to known degradation processes such as carbon corrosion, Pt migration and modifications at low temperature. Over the past 5 years the Hitchcock group has collaborated with researchers at the Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation (AFCC) Corporation and Ballard Power systems to develop STXM as a means to provide unique analytical information which can assist with materials and process optimization. Studies have been performed on the role of N-containing ligands of Pt catalyst precursors in Pt migration

In order to develop confidence in 3D ionomer mapping and to have a means of evaluating the spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy of competing 3D chemical mapping techniques, we developed in parallel a standard test sample, which could be prepared in a simple reproducible manner, with known properties, which contained all of the chemical components of the PEM-FC cathode system but with a much simpler spatial organization. Figure

Biological: Wet Chemical Mapping:
Biological or biogeochemical samples are often not compatible with sample preparation methods that involve sample dehydration and solvents that alter sample composition and thus would affect the chemical analysis. At the cost of ultrastructural details, air or vacuum drying is often used for samples that are compatible and not subject to cell lysis. However, some samples need to be analyzed in their natural hydrated state to avoid drying artefacts and to evaluate possible artefacts from the drying procedure. There are several mounting approaches that allow for STXM spectro-tomography of natural, hydrated samples. STXM spectro-tomography has been performed on wet biological samples in pulled glass capillaries and in wet cells developed in collaboration with Luxel (Friday Harbor, USA) that are based on a metal frame coated with polyimide membranes on both sidesClearly indicated in Fig.

Strengths and Limitations of STXM Spectro-tomography:
As shown in the previous sections, STXM spectro-tomography allows for quantitative 3D mapping not only of elements but also of chemical species. In particular the statistical (correlation) analysis of chemical datasets in 3D turns out to be powerful for gaining insights into reaction mechanisms and for efficiently analyzing the spatial distribution of chemical species with different affinities for each other such as EPS that sorbs metal ions and the precipitation of a mineral phase. This approach relies significantly on speciation capabilities and on spatial resolution in 3D. Most soft X-ray STXM-beamlines are optimized for spectro-microscopy and, with energy resolving power E/ΔE > 3000, provide excellent chemical speciation capabilities making them ideally suited for chemical nano-tomography. One of the major advantages of STXM spectro-tomography with soft X-rays in comparison to hard X-ray techniques is the accessibility of absorption edges of light elements such as C, N and O. In particular for biological, biogeochemical and for polymer science, this allows for employing the chemically specific, intrinsic absorption contrast of the sample to map the distribution of organic molecules in 3D, which is not accessible using higher-energy photons of hard X-rays. Simultaneously, the energy range of soft X-rays is a major limiting factor of STXM spectrotomography as the high absorption of these low-energy photons requires the sample thickness to be restricted to the sub-μm up to few μm ranges, depending on sample composition and density.Another disadvantage of the approach is the limited accessibility of synchrotron beamtime via proposal-based, peer-reviewed access and by the so far limited efficiency due to long acquisition times and a poor duty cycle. The situation regarding the latter problem can be expected to improve in the next years with installation of next-generation STXM instruments that will allow for a more automated acquisition and thus better duty cycle, as explained in the next sections.

Future Instrument and Technique Developments:
STXM spectro-tomography provides the most value added when applied to systems that are difficult or impossible to study by analytical TEM tomography, which typically means highly radiation-sensitive materials (such as the PFSA ionomer in PEM-FC) or when one wishes to perform 3D chemical analysis of wet samples (e.g. to avoid drying artefacts of sensitive structures such as microbial extracellular biopolymers). Recently there have been dramatic improvements in the ability of modern TEMs to handle wet samples and in situ modifications of samples by, e.g. electrochemistryAlternatives to tilt-series tomography scanning include stereo-imaging, which is being developed in the hard X-ray regionFinally, perhaps the most exciting near-future instrumentation development is soft X-ray spectro-ptycho-tomography. The Nanosurveyor instrument at ALS (presently on BL 5.3.2.1, and soon to move to the COSMIC beamline) is fully equipped for 3D chemical imaging by ptycho-tomography, and the first data sets already exist. In addition to improved instrumentation, there are continual improvements in the data analysis and extraction of value-added information from post-3D reconstruction methods. For example, a recent development particularly well suited (but not yet applied) to STXM spectro-tomography is 3D reconstruction using compressed sensing (CS), a method known from other fields which is now being applied to TEM tomography

Improvements in Sample Mounting and Acquisition:
With the possibility of analyzing samples in their pristine, hydrated state, STXM spectro-tomography has significantly reduced one of the major limitations, in particular in the field of biological and biogeochemical sciences, but also for material sciences, namely, artefacts from sample drying. First experiment using glass micro-capillaries as sample mounts on the one hand had the advantage of a rotation range of AE90 so that this approach was not affected by the missing wedge problem. On the other hand, the strong absorption of the glass walls did not allow for accessing the C 1s absorption edge and significantly limited the energy range accessible at the O 1s absorption edge. Furthermore, the capillaries were quite flexible and thus subject to vibrations when scanned on the piezo-driven sample stage, which limits spatial resolution. With the development of wet cells in collaboration with Luxel (Friday Harbor, USA) that are based on metal frames coated with polyimide membranes on both sides, the limited energy range was overcome.In the meantime, the second, improved version of the wet tomo cells further reduced vibrations by optimizing the geometric design and facilitated the filling procedure by providing filling channels in the metal frame structure. The most modern, next-generation STXMs will allow for scanning the ZP in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis instead of scanning the sample. Current instruments move the sample using a fast piezo-driven scanner. As the rotation stage for tomography is mounted onto the piezo scanner, the rotation stage and sample mounting needs to be optimized for a weight of a few 10s of grams. This is the main reason why until today there have not been any successful attempts of using a eucentric rotation stage that is mounted on the piezo scanner. The capabilities of scanning the ZP instead of the sample will allow for using more bulky and stable, eucentric rotation stages that can be adapted from TEM tomography. With a eucentric stage the sample will not go out of focus or move laterally out of the field of view during rotation, which will allow for more efficient and eventually automated data acquisition similar to scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography. At the same time, this will allow for using the previously mentioned cryo-stage for sample mounting, so that frozen hydrated samples can be analyzed in 3D by STXM spectro-tomography. The analysis of samples in the frozen state has advantages for sample preparation and reduced beam-induced damage due to radical formation that can become a problem in particular when analyzing hydrated samples in wet cells.

Definition of the Topic X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) allows to access a wide variety of dynamic phenomena at the nanoscale by studying the temporal correlations among photons that are scattered by a material when it is illuminated using a coherent X-ray beam. Here, we describe how XPCS is used to study the dynamics of soft and hard condensed matter, review the recent literature and briefly discuss the future of the

Introduction:
Scattering experiments based on coherent X-ray beams have opened new possibilities for the investigation of soft and hard condensed matter (reviews and relevant bibliography can be found in

Static Speckle:
Speckles are easily observed with highly coherent illumination. When a laser pointer impinges on a surface that is rough at the scale of the wavelength-such as a piece of paper or a wall-the illuminated spot is not uniform and has areas with very high and very low (or zero) intensities, randomly arranged. A simulated speckle pattern is shown in Fig.We consider a system of N particles that is illuminated by a coherent monochromatic wave with amplitude E 0 and wave vector k ! far from the system is obtained by summing up all the wavelets scattered by the individual particles and taking into account the phase shifts between them. In a quantum mechanics formalism, this procedure is equivalent to a superposition of the scattering probability amplitudes. In the case of individual scatterers, the instantaneous total scattered field at momentum transfer q The prefactor E 0 exp i kcorresponds to the amplitude scattered by a free electron (other prefactors have been omitted and polarisation is not considered). The negative sign accounts for the π phase shift.being the wave vector of the scattered wave (Fig.2) represents the resultant of the sum of N phasors of the form Ae ϕ , A and ϕ being the (time and momentum transfer dependent) amplitude and phase, respectively. 1 If b j (q, t) or the position of the scatterers, R ! j (t), changes with time,The derivation of Eqs. (3.2) and (3.3) from the scattering of a set of N particles is very adequate to describe, for example, the scattering by a colloidal system. For other systems, such as surfaces, it may be more adequate to consider a continuous electron density and replace the summation in Eq. (3.2) by an integral. In that case, the instantaneous total electric field isthen the total scattered field at q ! (Eq. (3.2)) fluctuates. The electric fields E ( q ! , t) and E (q ! , t + Δt) will still be correlated if the time difference Δt is small. However, for long time differences, the fluctuations of the electric field become completely uncorrelated. Information about the dynamics of the scatterers is encoded in these fluctuations and can be extracted using correlation functions (see Sect.Both the instantaneous intensity and the instantaneous electric field are extremely sensitive to any slight changes in position. That is why the speckle pattern depends on the exact arrangement of the scatterers. However, it has to be taken into account that in an experiment the measurement of the intensity is done over an acquisition time T. Thus, the measured intensity does not exactly correspond to that of Eq. (3.3) but to a time average of the instantaneous intensity (I inst ) over the acquisition timeIf the system is static or it fluctuates at timescales much larger than the acquisition time, then I exp ~Iinst . However, if the system fluctuations are much faster than the acquisition time, the intensity fluctuations will be averaged during the measurement and I exp will be featureless (in time).A last remark: when the intensity is measured, information about the phase is lost. This is the so-called phase problem of crystallography. Phase retrieval techniques could be applied to retrieve the positions of the scatterers from the speckle pattern. This problem is beyond the scope of this chapter. An extensive set of references can be found in

Statistical Properties of Static Speckle Patterns:
The speckle pattern not only contains information about the arrangement of the scatterers but also provides information about the light that produced it, namely, the degree of coherence and the illuminated area. The degree of coherence can be estimated studying the first-order statistical properties (i.e. at a single point in space) of the intensities. 2 For fully coherent illumination, if the number of phasors that contribute to the speckle pattern is very large, their phases are uniformly distributed over (Àπ, π) and their amplitudes and phases are statistically independent, then the speckle pattern follows negative exponential statistics and the probability density function of the intensity is given byThe overline denotes a statistical average. I ¯is the mean of the intensity and the standard deviation isFor partially coherent illumination, either because the illumination volume is larger than the coherence volume or because the illumination is not fully coherent, the speckle pattern can be thought as arising from the sum of N independent speckle patterns. The probability distribution for a speckle pattern resulting from the intensity sum of N independent speckle patterns, all with identical average intensity I 0 , is described by a gamma density function of order NN is the number of coherence volumes. I ¯= N I 0 is the total mean intensity. The standard deviation is σis the limiting case of (3.6) when N ! 1. Equations (3.4) andThe probability density functions (3.4) and (3.6) correspond to two ideal cases. In general, the illumination will not be fully coherent, and the speckle pattern will not be the sum of many patterns with the same average intensity either. For example, in some cases, the speckle pattern can be superimposed to a constant intensity background. Abernathy et al. showed experimentally that by subtracting the contribution of this background, it is possible to obtain a good quantitative estimation of the contrast value

Size and Shape of Speckles:
The angular width of the speckles produced by an object illuminated with a fully coherent beam of size L isThe q th moments of the distribution (3.4) are given by I q ¼ I q q!. Thus, the second moment is I 2 ¼ 2I 2 . For more details, seewhere L is the size of the aperture delimiting the beam (Fig.Sinha, Tolan and Gibaud

X-Ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy:
If the sample structure varies with time, the corresponding speckle pattern will also reflect this time dependent variation. The speckle intensity fluctuations provide information about the dynamics of the system. Such information can be accessed by measuring the temporal intensity autocorrelation function g (2) ( q ! , Δt) defined by:The superscript (2) indicates that g (2) is a temporal correlation function of order two on the electric fields, i.e. four field variables are correlated at two different times. I t is the intensity at time t and at momentum transfer q ! , I( q ! , t) (Eq. (3.3)). For clarity, the quantities between brackets have been removed. Δt is the time delay. The brackets hi denote a time average. The bar hi indicates the ensemble average over wave vectors with equivalent | q ! | momentum transfer value and for which it is expected that the correlations are statistically equivalent.For short time delays, the value of Eq. (3.9) is high because the structure will still be similar to its initial configuration. As the structure evolves, the correlation will decrease, and at long delay times (compared with the period of the fluctuations), the correlation with respect to the initial state will be lost. For a non-periodic function, the time correlation function will decay from its initial value hI 2 i to hIi 2A very important case occurs when the total scattered field can be considered to arise from the sum of a large number of statistically independent subregions. In that case, the central limit theorem of statistics (see, e.g. Ref.with) is a factor that is used to account for the degree of coherence of the incident radiation, depends also on the experimental set-up 4 and is given by the variance of the intensity (σ 2 ) divided by its mean valueSiegert relation can be rewritten in terms of the intermediate scattering function of the sample, S( q ! , Δt):whereor alternatively,if a continuous electron density is considered. N is the number of scatterers and S ( q) is the static structure factor. S ( q ! , Δt), the intermediate scattering function, is the spatial Fourier transform of the Van Hove correlation function

Example: System of Noninteracting Monodisperse Particles:
Undergoing Brownian Motion Let's illustrate the use of XPCS with an example and determine which kind of information can be derived from it. Let's consider a dynamic system of identical particles undergoing Brownian motion in a dilute suspension. Using Eqs. (3.2) and (3.11), g (1) ( q ! , Δt) can be expressed as:Considering identical, particles that do not change shape Eq. (3.15) simplifies to:For noninteracting particles, the cross terms j 6 ¼ k in Eq. (3.16) average to zero because their positions are uncorrelated. Using Eqs. (3.10) and (3.12), the intermediate scattering function is:. Thus, for this particular case, an XPCS experiment in which S ( q ! , Δt) is obtained would yield information about the average motion of a single particle. For particles in Brownian motion, the probability that a particle is found between R ! and R ! + dR ! after a certain time t is a Gaussian probability distributionThen, using Eq. (3.18) to evaluate Eq. (3.16), one obtains:D 0 , the diffusion constant for a sphere of radius a moving in a medium of viscosity η, is given by the Stokes-Einstein equation:k B and T are Boltzmann's constant and the temperature, respectively. Thus, by measuring the intensity-intensity autocorrelation (3.9) (see also Fig.When the interparticle interaction cannot be neglected or when the system is polydisperse, the two approximations that were made to simplify Eq. (3.15) and obtain Eq.In concentrated systems, the interactions between the particles cannot be neglected and the motions of the different particles can be strongly correlated. In such systems, the diffusion coefficient can have a very marked dependence on q ! , and the behaviour of the intermediate scattering function may differ from a single exponential decay. To describe such systems, the diffusion coefficient D 0 is often replaced by a coefficient D ( q ! , t) that depends on the scattering vector and the time

Functional Shape of the Correlation Function:
In the example of Sect. (Δt) q 2q 3q Fig.Δt cor is the correlation time. γ is the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts exponent in the decaying function. γ > 1 (γ < 1) implies that the decay is faster (slower) than purely exponentialarise in the study for perfect gas dynamicsare observed in processes where many different timescales are involved

XPCS of Non-equilibrium Systems:
For non-equilibrium systems (i.e. for systems with average properties changing with time), the time average in Eq. (3.9) cannot be performed because the dynamics are evolving and may strongly depend on the sample age. For those systems the evolution of the correlation function can still be captured by using a more general expression than Eq. (3.9), namely, a two-time correlation function (TTCF)Γ is the autocovariance of the intensity normalised by its standard deviation. Different correlation functions are also usedwhereFor random Gaussian fluctuations the standard deviation equals the average intensity

Experimental and Instrumental Methodology:
XPCS experiments require a coherent source, an extremely stable set-up and a detector with very high angular resolution and sufficient speed. These requirements pose some limitations or boundaries to the technique. The absence of lasers in the X-ray regime has limited the use of XPCS to synchrotrons, although with the development of the new free electron lasers, the panorama is already changing (see Sect. 6). The principal factor that limits the timescales that can be probed with XPCS is the flux of coherent photons that impinge on the sample. An approximate criterion is that at least one scattered photon per speckle over the timescale probed is needed

Coherent X-Ray Source:
In XPCS experiments the samples must be illuminated with a coherent X-ray beam. For a chaotic X-ray source such as third-generation synchrotron radiation storage rings, the two transverse (or spatial) coherence lengths5 For a scattering geometry with incident wave 5In general, the specific prerequisites for the degree of coherence and wavefront curvature depend on the application. For example, other techniques such as phase contrast imaging typically require a planar wavefrontvector k ! i = k(0, 1, 0) and scattered wave vector k ! f = k(sin 2θ cos ϕ, cos 2θ, sin 2θ sin ϕ), the path length difference (δ) for two points rEquation (3.28) can be specified for Bragg geometry (reflection) and transmission geometrieswhere λ is the X-ray wavelength and Δλ is the spectral width. For synchrotron sources, with a Gaussian intensity distribution of the formthe transverse coherence length in the vertical (horizontal) direction is given byσ v,h being the vertical (horizontal) source size (rms) and L the distance between the source and the observation point. ξ t v,h can also be considered as a measure of the degree of collimation of the radiation in the vertical (horizontal) plane. These lengths are generally much smaller than the cross-section of the full beam. 6 For an X-ray beam, a practical requirement to obtain good coherence properties is that the beam size ϕ at the sample position fulfilswhere ϵ is the divergence (full width at half maximum) of the beam. The beam size is generally determined by slit apertures or pinholes, while the divergence can be intrinsic from the source or further modified by optical elements. By tuning the beam size and divergence, the spatial coherence properties can be adjusted. However, satisfying condition (3.32) always results in an important reduction of intensity with respect to the full beam. The coherent flux in XPCS experiments at the ESRF is typically of the order of 10 10 -11 11 ph/s. An intensity increase can be achieved by using focusing elements. Yet, focusing elements modify the coherence length and alter the shape of the wavefrontof the second correlation function will be smaller than expected from the degree of coherence. Sometimes, one can trade off between intensity and coherence. For example, in small-angle scattering experiments, the monochromaticity conditionthat is, the longitudinal coherence length, Eq. (3.30)-can be relaxed and optics such as multilayer mirrors that allow for a wider bandpass than crystal monochromators can be usedThe time structure and the lifetime of the synchrotron beam need also special consideration. Synchrotron beams are composed of bunches that circulate along the storage ring. The time structure of the synchrotron beam will come up in the correlation function measured by XPCS. The actual time structure depends on the filling mode. As an example, the ESRF storage ring has a circumference of 844 m, and it takes ~2.8 μs for an electron to make a complete turn; in the uniform filling mode, there are 992 bunches of electrons equally distributed around the storage ring, which gives a characteristic time of 2.8 ns that would be detected by XPCS. In the 4 Â 10 mA filling mode (four equidistant bunches with 10 mA/bunch), a characteristic time of 0.7 μs would be detected. Thus, the frequencies due to the synchrotron beam time structure may be an issue when studying very fast dynamics if the dynamics under study have very similar frequencies. In addition, the beam decay has also to be taken into account, especially when analysing slow dynamics. In a synchrotron, the beam intensity decays exponentially as I SR / e Àt=t 0 , where t 0 is the lifetime (of the order of ~60 h for the uniform filling mode at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility -ESRF). The autocorrelation of this decaying intensity is:e Àτ=t 0 (3:33) q = 0.00279 nm -1 q = 0.00479 nm -1 q = 0.00750 nm -1 0.1 The autocorrelation of a dynamic system illuminated with a decaying beam will have contributions from the dynamics due to the sample and to the beam decay:sample . Normalising the data to the incoming intensity may therefore be necessary to circumvent the contribution from the beam decay. When using a 2D detector, if the static structure factor does not change with time, the integrated intensity of the images can also be used for normalisation.

Set-Up: Stability and Coherence Preserving ElementsAny movement of the set-up, vibration, drift or instability may cause spurious dynamics that would be reflected on the autocorrelation function; hence, the complete set-up (i.e. optical elements, sample environment and detection system) must be extremely stable. Small changes in the optical path or the illuminated area on the optical elements due to beam movements can alter the coherence properties at the sample position. This is especially relevant when using elements operated at glancing incidence, such as mirrors, because in this geometry the aberrations become particularly importantFraunhofer diffraction patterns from slits can be used to assess qualitatively the suitability of optical elements or beamline components for coherence experiments. We placed a 4 mm thick unpolished 360 beryllium window of a vacuum chamber for in-situ X-ray scattering experiments

Detectors:
In the same way as it is done in DLS, XPCS experiments can be realised using a point detector coupled with a correlator electronics that works out the intensity autocorrelation function. Besides the limit set by the correlator electronics, X-ray detectors also set a limit to the fastest accessible timescales. The fastest point detectors at present are the avalanche photodiodes, which have a dead time of ~1 ns or lower. Scintillation detectors can only be used up to few hundred kHzIn the case of point detectors, slits are placed in front of the detector to define the resolution. If the slits are too large, several speckles will be integrated on the detector, and the signal-to-noise ratio may be improved at the expense of optical contrast. This aspect is very important in XPCS, because in many cases XPCS is a signal-limited technique. For 2D detectors, the resolution is determined by the pixel size. By choosing the right detector distance, which depends on the angular pixel size and the angular source size, the signal-to-noise ratio can be optimised. The best signal-to noise ratio is achieved when the detector is at a position where the angular pixel size matches the angular source size

Key Research Findings:
The number and type of XPCS studies is continuously increasing. The recent literature since 2009 is reviewed here although some older works have also been included. An important amount of work is related to technical developments, be it beamlines, sources or detectors (Sect. 5.1). Soft matter studies are presented in Sect. 5.2. Hard condensed matter studies are summarised in Sect. 5.3.There are other recent XPCS reviews in the literature. X-ray coherent scattering and XPCS are described in

Detectors:
XPCS experiments are an excellent benchmark test for detectors. The ideal detector for XPCS should have a large area to probe large regions of reciprocal space simultaneously; a very small pixel size and, hence, an excellent resolution to be able to resolve the speckles; a uniform and linear response to radiation to prevent artefacts on the time correlations; and a very high framing rate with minimal dead time to access fast dynamics. A criterion that is not usually crucial when using synchrotron sources is the dynamic range because often the measured signals are weak. However, high detection efficiency is required. For X-ray free electron lasers, high dynamic range and radiation hardness are also imperative.At present, the fastest detectors are point detectors (0D) such as avalanche photodiodes, which can have a time resolution better than 1 nsThe readout time is often what restricts the time resolution of 2D detectors and what limits their use for studying fast dynamics. A variation of XPCS, X-ray speckle visibility spectroscopy (XSVS), can overcome this limitationNew detector developments are under way, especially foreseeing the future operation of the European XFEL and other free electron laser sources. The Adaptive Gain Integrating Pixel Detector (AGIPD), which will be able to operate at 4.5 MHz, is one example of the projects that are being carried outA pixel array detector prototype based on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has been proposed inThe interest of having detectors with small pixel size was already highlighted in

Beamlines and Set-Ups:
Sources with low emittance (i.e. the product of the source size and the divergence) are essential for coherent X-ray techniques. XPCS does not require a high degree of coherence, and often a trade-off between coherence and intensity is sought (see Sect. 4.1). The design of the coherent hard X-ray (CHX) scattering beamline of NSLS-II has been optimised for XPCS experiments. CHX is designed to obtain a partially coherent beam at the sample with a degree of coherence within 0.1-0.5 and a maximised intensity on the sample, which will allow to study timescales two orders of magnitude faster than currently existing beamlinesSoft X-ray pulsed lasers, combined with a time-delayed beam splitting system, have been used to study ferroelectric materials with XPCS (see also Sect. 5.3.1). The time delay is achieved with a Michelson-type system composed of a beam splitter and two multilayer mirrorsMany XPCS soft matter experiments are done in SAXS geometry (see Sect. 5.2). A compact chamber for low temperature (110-330 K) and low magnetic field (up to 0.12 T) SAXS studies has been developed recently and can be applied to study, for example, supercooled liquids and ferrofluids

Colloids:
Understanding the dynamical behaviour and stability of colloidal suspensions is of interest in many areas ranging from industrial products (food, cosmetics, paints, etc.) to fundamental science and biology. The volume fraction, the strength and nature of the colloidal interactions, temperature, etc. are parameters that influence the physicochemical, transport and rheological properties of colloids. Fluid, gel and glassy states often appear in the phase diagrams of colloidal suspensions, and they can also exhibit remarkable rheological properties like shear thickening or thinning. The study of colloids in solution with XPCS is the natural extension of visible light PCS studies into the X-ray regime, where much shorter lengths can be investigated and multiple scattering is, in general, negligible. Indeed, one of the first XPCS works inquired into the Brownian motion of gold colloids in glycerol and the findings were consistent with results extrapolated from visible light PCSThe dependence of concentration and ionic strength on the collective diffusion of charge-stabilised fluorinated latex spheres in aqueous suspensions was investigated ineffect of the hydrodynamic interactions on the short-time dynamics of the colloidal suspensionThe dynamical behaviour of sterically stabilised poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) colloidal suspensions was studied for different volume fractions (Φ) up to Φ % 0.49The equilibrium dynamics of concentrated suspensions of polystyrene microspherical particles dispersed in glycerol for volume fractions in the 10-20 % range have been studied combining USAXS and XPCS. It has been found that the effective diffusion coefficient shows a peak when represented against the momentum transfer q, the relaxation time is inversely proportional to q and the autocorrelation functions are better described by stretched exponential shapes. These three findings suggest that the microspheres move collectivelyThe dynamics as a function of the volume fraction of dilute suspensions of stiff, platelet-shaped phosphatoantimonate particles was investigated incoefficient in the lamellar phase decreases with concentration and remains constant across the liquid to gel transition. This implies that longer length and timescales than those probed in the experiment are involved in the transitionA transition from Brownian to hyperdiffusive motion was observed in the dynamics of sterically stabilised silica colloidal particles used as tracers in a supercooled solventThe porosity of a material can also influence its dynamics. In porous materials (aerogels and nanocomposite aerogels with iron oxide particles), hyperdiffusive dynamics have been detected at room temperature. On the other hand, in non-porous polymer xerogels, no significant dynamics have been observed. Thus, the dynamics seem to arise from the porous structure and not from the presence of nanoparticles

Ageing Phenomena:
Ageing, that is, changes in dynamics that occur as time goes by, is a very interesting phenomenon that arises in a wide variety of systems. Ageing behaviour is characterised by a slowing down of the relaxation times with sample age, although ageing does not necessarily imply a change in the type of dynamics.As shown inIn a glassy colloidal suspension of laponite, in spontaneously aged samples, the correlation functions are stretched with a decay slower than a pure exponential (i.e. β < 1). However, if the system is sheared, the correlation function is compressed and the decay is faster than exponential (i.e. β > 1). In both cases, the relaxation time scales as τ / q À1 (Fig.0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 Q (nm -1 )1.021.00 t w =2.9.10 3 s 0.05 nm -1 0.06 nm -1 0.07 nm -1 0.08 nm -1 0.085 nm -1 0.09 nm -1 0.10 nm -1 0.11 nm -1 0.12 nm -11.161.12 evolves into a Wigner glass in which a long-range screened coulombic repulsion dominates; after much longer waiting times, of the order of days, a second glass state, stabilised by orientational attractions between clay platelets, appears (disconnected house of cards). This glass-glass transition that takes place as a result of the competition between electrostatic repulsion and orientation-dependent attraction is probably a generic feature of heterogeneously charged systems when driven out of equilibriumThe dynamics of filler particles in stretched-filled elastomers were studied by homodyne and heterodyne XPCS combined with tensile stress. The dynamics show ageing. The measurements yield compressed correlation functions and indicate that motion of filler particles is ballistic and also show that stretching induces a shear effectNanocomposites formed by a liquid crystal-4 0 -pentyl-4-biphenylcarbonitrile (5CB)-and dispersed silica nanoparticles show intriguing ageing dynamics with an anisotropic relaxation rate (Fig.A transition from stretched to compressed exponential decay with increasing scattering vector is observed on the dynamics of spherical silica colloids in ice. The samples are prepared by diluting the silica particles in water and subsequent freezing. Ice has a dentritic morphology, and during freezing, regions with high density of silica particles are created. In these regions, the silica particles move ballistically and their velocity increases with temperature. The transition of the KWW exponent from <1 to >1 may be related to ice grain boundary migration induce by the coarsening of the ice crystalThe dynamics of a laponite colloidal suspension across the glass transition has been studied over a wide range of momentum transfer and timescales in

Rheology:
One advantage of studying samples under flow is that beam-induced damage is limited. But more importantly, effects in the diffusion due to confinement, the influence of strain on the flowing properties, etc. can be studied. As a model example, the dynamics of a hard-sphere (PMMA) suspension was investigated in transverse and longitudinal laminar flow. Although the static properties are found to be isotropic in the range of parameter values studied-average flow velocities between 0 and 200 mm s À1 and q-values between 3 and 10 in q Á a units, a being the particle radius-the dynamic properties are not isotropic: while in transverse flow (i.e. q ! ⊥ v ! ), the correlation functions are unaffected by the flow (Fig.Similar findings have been reported in a study of the dynamics due to advection and diffusion under homogeneous shear flow of charge-stabilised 100 nm radius polystyrene particles suspended in glycerolLong-range properties like the connectivity of the gel structure or the bond percolation seem to play a minor role in the local dynamics and rheological properties of a gel formed on cooling moderately concentrated suspensions of silica colloidsDeviations from the simplified mode-coupling theory predictions are observed in the temporal evolution of gel formation and ageing in suspensions of silica nanocolloids for a volume fraction of Φ = 0.43 and close to the gel transition. By reducing the temperature below the theta point, a short-range attractive interaction is suddenly introduced. The suspensions maintain their fluid nature for a very long latency period longer than usual before acquiring a measurable elastic shear modulus. The length of the latency period depends on the strength of the interparticle attractionWhen oscillatory shear strain is applied to a concentrated nanocolloidal gel of silica spheres, periodic peaks appear on the intensity autocorrelation function. If the applied strain is above a threshold, the amplitude of the peaks decays exponentially with the number of shear cycles, which indicates that the particles undergo irreversible rearrangements. The decay rate of the amplitude of the peaks depends on the momentum transfer value, and a power law distribution in the sizes of the regions that rearrange due to shear is determined. Below a threshold, the microscopic rearrangements are reversible

Polymers:
Polymers are a large class of soft matter systems that display a very rich variety of structural and dynamical properties. As a result of the long, string-like, flexible configurations of polymers, many of their properties have universal attributes such as scaling laws and characteristic exponentsThe gelation of a cross-linked polymer composed of resorcinol and formaldehyde was studied by XPCS and SAXS. Two relaxations are observed: a fast, non-ergodic relaxation related to the stiffening of the polymer network and a slow relaxation due to the stress relaxation dynamics of the network that restores ergodicity to the system. No dynamical heterogeneity is observedMechanical reinforcement in polymer nanocomposites seems to be controlled by interparticle interactions, as has been suggested from XPCS, electron microscopy and rheology experiments on polystyrene homopolymers mixed with polystyrenegrafted silica nanoparticles

Surfaces, Films and Systems Under Confinement:
Research on the dynamic fluctuations on surfaces, thin films or systems in confinement is one of the principal areas where XPCS is appliedMonitoring the surface height fluctuations due to thermally induced capillary waves in polystyrene top layers (thickness in the 27-127 nm range) in bilayer films, for underlaying films with very different elastic moduli, it has been determined that the capillary wave relaxation, close to the glass transition temperature, depends on two factors: the substrate modulus and the film thickness. Faster relaxations are observed on the polystyrene film if the substrate modulus is lower, and capillary waves relax faster for thinner films. Far from the glass transition temperature, confinement and substrate-induced effects disappearIn polymer blends, a thin layer with a composition that differs from the bulk may form at the free surface due to preferential segregation of one of the components to the surface. The surface chain dynamics can also be different from those of the bulk, as has been shown for poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME) chains at the free surface of a polystyrene and PVME blend. Two relaxations are observed. From the analysis of the dependence of the relaxation times with respect to momentum transfer and film thickness, the two relaxations are ascribed to two separate populations of chains in two environments. One of the populations undergoes translational motion and the other, ballistic and caged behaviourThe influence that a low concentration (below 0.1 % in weight) of gold nanoparticles has on the dynamics of photosensitive azopolymer Langmuir-Schaefer films deposited on silicon was studied inThe surface dynamics of the [bmim][BF 4 ] ionic liquid has been investigated at the transition from propagating to overdamped thermal capillary waves. [bmim][BF 4 ] has a dense layer, 0.6 nm thick, at the free surface which may affect the dynamics. However, the XPCS results can be explained using linear response theory, and the influence of the dense surface layer in the dynamics can be ruled out

Magnetism and Related Phenomena:
Antiferromagnetic domain fluctuations in bulk chromium were examined with XPCS for temperatures below and above the Néel temperature, by measuring the time variation of the speckle pattern at the region of theThe charge density wave dynamics of nominally pure and Ti-doped TaS 2 have been investigated inNear a thermally driven spin-reorientation phase transition, the Au/Co/Au heterostructure presents slow magnetic fluctuations that yield stretched exponential autocorrelations. Sensitivity to magnetism is achieved tuning the X-ray energy to the L 3 edge of cobalt (778 eV). In that study, it is assumed that the charge scattering does not change in time. The stretched shape of the autocorrelation suggests that there is cooperative motion through the phase transition. The local magnetisation of the system changes continuously from a perpendicular to an in-plane orientationExtremely fast relaxation times could be accessed using a pulsed soft X-ray laser. The nanoscale dipole moments in polarisation clusters in BaTiO 3 fluctuate at timescales in the picosecond range. These timescales are not accessible using synchrotron radiation, but using a Michelson-type delay pulse generator and acquiring data for single laser shots at different delay times, the intensity autocorrelation function can be obtained. The relaxation times are of the order of tens of picoseconds. The longest relaxation time (~90 ps) is found at 4.5 K degrees above the Curie temperature and coincides with the temperature at which the polarisation is maximumThe dynamics near the charge ordering temperature in the valence fluctuation compound Eu 3 S 4 were studied in

Surface Dynamics:
A quasihexagonal reconstruction of the Au(001) surface can be obtained by hightemperature annealing (T ~1200 K) in vacuum. This quasihexagonal reconstruction has been studied by XPCS analysing the intensity fluctuations near the (1.2 1.2 0.3) reflection of the quasihexagonal phase and the (001) anti-Bragg reflection of the substrate. The data could be fitted with pure exponentials and relaxation times in the range of 10-10 6 were obtained. The speckle fluctuations at the bulk (002) Bragg reflection are much slower than at the (001)

Atomic Diffusion:
Atomic diffusion can be studied with XPCS by measuring along several reciprocal space directions the intensity fluctuations in the diffuse scattering, away from Bragg peaks. The diffusion of single atoms in the intermetallic alloy Cu 90 Au 10 has been studied in this way, and the experimental correlation times can be explained using a model with nearest-neighbour exchanges, while a model that considers jumps between the second-nearest neighbours is inconsistent with the dataThe diffusive dynamics of a martensitic shape memory alloy (Au 50.5 Cd 49.5 ) are unusual. Slow non-equilibrium dynamics occur only in a narrow temperature interval close to the athermal martensitic phase transition. The speckle diffraction pattern on the (001) Bragg reflection changes abruptly at T c = 305.35 K within a temperature interval of less than 0.05 K. Above T c , the (one-time) autocorrelation functions have a compressed exponential shape with KWW exponent values up to 2. This has been explained as originating from strain dominated dynamics, as the martensitic transition induces strain fields due to the change in lattice symmetry. Below the transition temperature they are almost exponential. At a temperature close to T c , the behaviour is better characterised by a two-time correlation function, and it shows that the dynamics slow down gradually and present avalanche-like features, which are ascribed to sudden progressions of the phase transition

Metallic Glasses:
The dynamics of the metallic glass former Mg 65 Cu 25 Y 10 below and above the glass transition temperature (T g ~405 K) have been studied to determine what is the physical mechanism underlying structural relaxations and how these depend on the thermal history and waiting time. A dynamical crossover takes place between the supercooled liquid phase and the metastable glass state: the shape of the correlation function changes abruptly across the transition. In the supercooled state, the dynamics are diffusive and the correlation functions are stretched exponentials. The dynamics in the glass state are driven by internal stress relaxation and the correlation functions are compressed exponentials. The relaxation of stress depends on the thermal history of the samples and different ageing regimes are foundThe crystallisation of the metallic glass Zr 65 Ni 10 Cu 17.5 Al 7.5 and the influence of temperature on the dynamics have been investigated with XPCS. The pristine samples were prepared in the glassy state by melt spinning followed by cold rolling of ribbons and were studied in transmission geometry. The correlations have a compressed exponential decay and the dynamics slow down progressively. The data are explained with a phenomenological model. According to the results, crystallisation and atomic mobility are manifestations of the same process

Self-Organised Systems:
Diverse non-equilibrium systems can form similar self-organised patterns, and often, their evolution is described by using equivalent modelsThe dynamics of GaSb(001) during sputtering at normal incidence with 500 eV argon ions have been studied experimentally with XPCSΔq , Δq being the FWHM of the GISAXS peak

Conclusions and Future PerspectiveThe use of XPCS to study the dynamics of slow processes (t > 1 μs) of soft and hard condensed matter systems is continuously increasing. New detectors and dedicated synchrotron beamlines will undoubtedly contribute to further develop such studies. But the developments from which XPCS will benefit most are the 'ultimate' or diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs)XFELs will be a completely new playground. A survey of the requirements and challenges of XPCS experiments at XFEL sources is presented inwhere I 0 is the intensity of the incident beam, μ is the X-ray absorption coefficient, and x is the sample thickness (Fig.where E B is the binding energy of the photoelectron and hν is the energy of the impinging photon. The binding energy depends on the atomic number, Z. Detailed tables with the binding energies of K and L shells are listed in the X-ray DataBookletfor K-and L 3 -edges, respectively. (Right) Attenuation cross sections of PtA characteristic XAFS spectrum recorded at the Fe-K-edge is displayed in Fig.After proper treatment of the EXAFS spectrum, which includes the subtraction of a rather smooth atomic absorption (as it will be discussed in Sect. 5), the χ(k) spectrum results. It actually provides the modification of the X-ray absorption The first and the second nearest neighbor shells of Ti are the octahedron formed by the six oxygen atoms and eight Ca atoms in a cubic arrangement, respectively. Single (SS), double (DS), and triple (TS) scattering paths with two, three, and four legs, respectively, which apply when Ca is the absorbing atom, are also shown coefficient, due to the presence of neighboring atoms, as a function of the photoelectron wave number. The χ(k) spectrum is a sum of sinusoidal functions of the distance R j of each neighboring shell, j, with modulated amplitude:where N j is the coordination number, σ j 2 the Debye-Waller factor, λ e the mean free path of the photoelectron, F j (k) the backscattering function of amplitude |F j (k)|, and argument Φ j (k) and δ i (k) is the phase shift induced by the absorbing atom during the emission of the photoelectron. The relatively small value of the photoelectron mean free path (few tens of Ǻ) is responsible for the fast damping of the EXAFS oscillations and thus its local character. S 0 2 is an amplitude reduction factor that usually takes values in the range 0.7-1 and accounts for inelastic losses. These processes lead to the excitation of the remaining (passive) electrons of the absorbing atom to a bound state (shake-up) and/or to a state in the continuum (shake-off). The Debye-Waller factor, σ j 2 , sums contributions for the thermal (due to vibrational motion of the atoms) and the static disorder. The former is strongly temperature dependent and thus measurements at low temperatures reduce the fast damping of the EXAFS oscillations. The Debye-Waller factor is defined as the mean square relative displacement projected along the bond direction, i.e.,where u ! j and u ! i are the displacements of the neighboring and absorbing atoms, respectively, and rj is the unit vector along the direction of the bond. In general, the Debye-Waller factor increases for further shells since the motion of distant neighboring atoms becomes weakly correlated to that of the absorbing atom. The Debye-Waller factors are usually fitting parameters. However, in systems with small structural disorder, its temperature-dependent component due to thermal disorder can be related to the local vibrational structurewhere ρ(R j )dR j is the probability of finding an atom of the jth shell at a distance between R j and R j + dR j . The distribution function, ρ(R j ), may be expanded in a moment series. To achieve better convergence, the logarithm of the Fourier transform of the effective distribution P R j , λ ewhere P k, R j À Á ¼ ð P R j , λ e À Á e i2kΔr d Δr ð Þ, Δr is defined as r = R j + Δr, and C n are the cumulantsA useful parameterization of χ(k), which allows for the extraction of structural parameters from the analysis of the EXAFS spectrum, is provided by Eq. (4.3). Some of the parameters that appear in the equation, e.g., the backscattering amplitude, the phase shifts, and the mean free path of the photoelectron, are calculated using proper software. Other parameters such as the nearest neighbor distances, the coordination numbers, and the Debye-Waller factors are obtained after proper fitting of the EXAFS spectra. The EXAFS formula (Eq. 4.3) can include both single and multiple scattering paths after proper calculation of the scattering function. For a detailed presentation of the theoretical background of XAFS, readers are referred to the books of TeoAs mentioned above, in the near-edge part of the XAFS spectrum, the emitted photoelectron has low kinetic energy and can thus be trapped shortly in unoccupied electron states. The initial state |ψ i i is a core state of well-defined energy, whereas the final state |ψ f i can be an antibonding molecular orbital state of a molecule or a state in the conduction band or even an empty defect state in a crystalline material. Even though the initial and the final states are actually multi-electron states, it is usually assumed that only one electron participates in the transition, whereas many body effects are taken into account at a later stagewhere H 0 /A ! Á p ! is the operator that accounts for the interaction of the electromagnetic field of the X-ray photon with the absorbing atom.is the spatial variation of the vector potential of the incident beam with ê being the unit vector that determines its polarization, p ! is the electron momentum operator, and ρ f (E) is the energy-dependent density of empty final states. Assuming the validity of the dipole approximation, the spatial dependence of the electric field can be approximated as1 because the wavelength of the X-ray beam is larger compared to the size of the atom and thus kr << 1. Taking also into account that the momentum of the electron can be described by the operator p ! ¼ Àiħ ∇ ! , after proper rearrangement of the quantum operators, the absorption coefficient can be written aswhere r ! is the position operator. Taking into account that synchrotron radiation is linearly polarized (unless special experimental arrangements are used, e.g., for the study of magnetic materials with circularly polarized beams), the absorption cross section depends, according to Eq. (4.8), on the orientation of the sample. Such a dependence is not observed in materials of cubic symmetry or in powder samples. Equation (4.8) imposes useful selection rules under the dipole approximation: Δ' ¼ AE1 and Δm ' ¼ 0 for linearly or Δm ' ¼ AE1 for circularly polarized light, where ' and m ' are the quantum numbers of angular momentum and its projection along the axis of external magnetic field, respectively. Thus, when the spectra are recorded at the K-edge, the initial state is an s-state with ' ¼ 0 and the final state should have (partial) p character (' ¼ 1).In crystalline materials, band structure methods apply for the calculation of the density of empty states taking into account proper projection to specific state symmetry according to the selection rules, as well as the presence of a core hole in the calculation of the energy of the final statewhere the sum runs over all final states and the delta function assures the conservation of energy. The sum over the final states and the delta function can be represented by a Green's function propagatorthat connects various scattering centers. H is the ground state Hamiltonian, and η is a lifetime that includes elastic and inelastic loses which provide a finite lifetime of the photoelectron andThus, the projected photoelectron density of final states can be written as the imaginary part of the one particle Green's function. Equation (4.9) can then be written asfunction around the Fermi level, E Fwhere Σ(E) accounts for many-body effects and the presence of the core hole is included in the V coul term. In multiple scattering theory, the potentialis usually approximated with "muffin-tin" potentials. The usefulness of the realspace Green function propagator is that it can be expressed as a sum of two contributions, G c and G sca , which stem from the absorbing atom and multiple scattering from the neighboring centers, respectively, where G 0 is the free particle propagator, T is the scattering matrix, and δ and δ΄ are the partial wave shifts. The term 1 À G 0 T Â Ã À1 G 0 can be written as a sum of terms G 0 TG 0 þ G 0 TG 0 TG 0 þ . . . that contains contributions of single and multiple scattering. This formulation can be used for the simulation of both the EXAFS and XANES parts of the spectrum. However, in the XANES region, convergence is usually achieved for full multiple scatteringIn Sects. 4 and 5, the experimental methodology and analysis procedure will be discussed and key research findings from the literature will be reviewed in Sect. 6.

Experimental and Instrumental Methodology XAFS spectra are almost exclusively recorded in synchrotron radiation (SR) facilities that offer X-ray beams with unique characteristics. The SR beam is emitted by light, charged particles, usually electrons, forced to move in closed orbits with a speed that approaches that of light. A list of the available SR facilities all over the world can be found in http://www.lightsources.org/. The main advantages of synchrotron radiation include the following: (1) It is emitted in a broad, continuous spectrum that can be monochromatized using suitable monochromators. (2) It has high flux that is defined as the emitted power per 0.1 % bandwidth. (3) The high flux in combination with the small divergence and beam size results in a beam with high brilliance that allows the study of diluted materials (i.e., with low concentration of the element of interest) or of small sample volumes. The beam size, depending on the facility and the beamline, takes values in the range 0.3-3 mm, but can be further decreased by using proper focusing (e.g., Kirkpatrick-Baez combination of two concave mirrors that focus the beam in two orthogonal directions) or beam size reduction (e.g., capillaries that reduce the beam size by total reflection) elements.The use of such experimental setups provides X-ray beams with diameter in the range 1-5 μm. In beamlines dedicated to X-ray spectromicroscopy, the use of zone plates provides spatial resolution better than 50 nmMost of the SR facilities all over the world offer beamlines for XAFS characterization. The use of a beam size at the mm or μm scale provides average information on the bonding configuration of the absorbing atom. Taking into account that nanomaterials comprise a broad family of nanosized materials (semiconductors, metal oxides, clusters of transition or noble metals, nanocomposites, carbon nanotubes, and others) which are built of elements with atomic numbers that range from 6 (C) to 78 (Pt), various experimental setups are used in suitable beamlines. The beamlines deliver the SR beam produced by an appropriate source in the storage ring, properly focused and monochromatized, to the position where the sample is located and the measurements take place. Three types of sources commonly exist in SR facilities: bending magnets, wigglers, and undulators. A bending magnet is a dipole magnet with uniform field between its poles that exerts a Lorentz force on the electron beam obliging it to move in curved trajectories, thus emitting SR tangentially in the horizontal plane. The opening angle of the beam is AE1/γ in radians (γ = E/mc 2 , where E, m, and c are the total energy, mass of the electrons, and the speed of light, respectively). Thus, the beam opening produced by a bending magnet in a storage ring with energy of 5 GeV is approximately 10 À4 rad. Wigglers and undulators are magnetic arrays that produce a magnetic field of alternating direction which forces the electron beam to move in sinusoidal trajectories. In the former case, the beam deflection is larger than the SR beam opening angle, whereas in the latter it is smaller. Bending magnets and wigglers generate a continuous spectrum (wigglers provide higher flux and "harder" radiation). On the other hand, undulators offer a quasi-monochromatic beam (fundamental energy and higher harmonics) of very high brilliance. Energy scanning with undulators is possible by changing the opening (gap) between the magnetic poles, thus changing the intensity of the magnetic fieldThe SR beam before impinging on the sample is modified by the beamline optics that mainly consist of focusing elements (curved mirrors that also act as filters of the unwanted part of the emitted spectrum from the source), the monochromator, and slits that decrease the beam size. In beamlines dedicated to spectromicroscopy or micro-XAFS, additional focusing elements are used, for example, Fresnel zone plates, Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors, or capillary opticsTo avoid contamination of the X-ray optical elements, the beamline is kept under vacuum. However, there are some differences in the beamlines dedicated to XAFS measurements in the soft and hard X-ray region. In the hard X-ray regime, crystal monochromators [usually SiIn the hard X-ray spectral range, the penetration depth of the beam is large, thus permitting measurements in the transmission mode (see Fig.When the XAFS spectra are recorded with soft X-rays, where r is the number of averaged spectra). Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio of the FLY signal can be significantly improved when multielement detectors are used.Different kinds of experiments require specific setups. For example, timeresolved XAFS measurements require very fast data acquisition that allows, for example, the in situ real-time study of chemical reactions. For that reason, bent crystal polychromators, which diffract each wavelength at a specific angle, are used. The beam passes though the sample and the transmitted beam is detected with a position sensitive detector, thus allowing the detection of a XAFS spectrum in time significantly shorter that 1 s

Spectrum Treatment and Analysis Procedure:
Prior to analysis, the XAFS spectra need special handling. Initially the spectra are corrected for energy shifts induced by the monochromator. In the hard X-ray regime, this is usually done using the energy position of the absorption edge of a reference metal foil. The exact energy of the absorption edge is determined by the maximum of the first derivative of the spectrum. In the soft X-ray regime, the position of the 1s ! π* sharp resonance of the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) located at 285.35 eV is often used. Another option is the use of the energy position of specific features due to O and C contamination in the spectrum of the Au grid (I 0 ), provided that it is recorded. The procedure used to extract the oscillatory part of the EXAFS spectrum and the NEXAFS/XANES part is shown graphically in Fig.First a straight line that fits the pre-edge region and simulates the background due to absorption of preceding edges or due to scattering is subtracted. Then the smooth atomic background, μ 0 , which corresponds to the absorption of the absorbing atom in the absence of neighboring atoms, is removed, and the resulting difference is normalized with the post-edge line which in most cases is the same with μ 0 .spectrum is converted from the energy space to the k-space using the equation k ¼where m is the electron mass and E 0 the binding energy of the electron or equivalently the position of the absorption edge. The k(E) relation, k, is a consequence of the energy conservation principle in the photoelectric effect. The resulting χ(k) spectrum, multiplied with k 2 to enhance the high-k contributions, is shown in Fig.The portion of the spectrum close to the absorption edge (Fig.To obtain structural information from the EXAFS spectra, the χ(k) spectrum (see Fig.Contrary to bulk crystalline materials, where the bonding configuration of the element of interest is approximately the same throughout the sample, in nanosized materials variation of the bonding environment is expected. This is due to the considerable number of surface atoms compared to the number of atoms in the "bulk," both contributing in the average XAFS signal. However the surface atoms are expected to have a reduced coordination number especially in the second or further shells. In addition to that, variations in the nearest neighbor distances are expected to occur due to local strains or relaxation at the surface of the nanocrystal. This effect may be reflected as an increase in the static disorder and consequent increase in the Debye-Waller factors. This problem has been identified since the 1980s when EXAFS was applied for the study of small metal clusters. Since then various models have been proposed which depend mainly on the shape and the symmetry of the nanocrystal. The application of these models in the analysis of the EXAFS spectra of nanosized materials allows for the determination of the size of the nanoparticles by correlating the observed reduction in the coordination numbers in comparison to the corresponding bulk values. Greegor and Lylte, where α is the smallest interatomic distance and N T is the total number of atoms in the cluster. Correspondingly, for a disk with packing along the (111) direction, the height C is given by C ¼ α 2:12 ffiffiffiffiffiffi N T p Á S. De Panfilis et al.where R 1 is the distance from the central atom to the first nearest neighbor. The dependence of the average coordination number, normalized to the value 12 that corresponds to a bulk crystal, on the size of the cluster is also plotted in Fig.16 ρ 3 , where ρ = 2R i /D, D is the diameter of the cluster and R i is the distance of the ith shell from the absorbing atom. Further discussion of size effects on the EXAFS coordination numbers in metallic clusters can be found in Refs.Contrary to the analysis of the EXAFS spectra, which is done by properly fitting the experimental spectrum in a path-by-path fashion, the analysis of NEXAFS spectra is not trivial. Four approaches are generally applied: (i) direct comparison of the spectra with those from reference compounds, (ii) linear combination of spectra of known compounds, (iii) fitting using a number of peak functions to determine the position and intensity of NEXAFS resonances, and (iv) simulation using full multiple scattering procedures. In all the above cases, prior to analysis, the NEXAFS spectra should be subjected to subtraction of a linear background and normalization to the edge jump or the atomic limit as described in Fig.Approach (iii) is applied when the XANES spectrum is considered proportional to the density of empty states in the conduction band, or to antibonding molecular orbital states, or even when information should be extracted from pre-edge peaks that appear in the spectra recorded at the K-edge of transition metals. An example of fitting of a C-K-edge XANES spectrum of the polymer poly(2,5-bis (3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno-[3,2-b] thiophene) [PBTTT] adopted from Ref.Additional valuable information on the geometry of the polyhedron formed around transition metal atoms (Fe, Mn, Co, V, Cr, etc.) as well as on their oxidation state can be obtained from the fitting of the pre-edge peaks that appear in their K-edge spectra. The pre-edge peak corresponds to transitions from the 1s initial state to a final (empty) d-state. Although such a transition is forbidden due to the Δ' ¼ AE1 selection rule in the dipole approximation, it gains intensity due to the p-d hybridization that is induced by the modification of the metal crystal field by its ligands. An example of a pre-edge peak fitting is shown in Fig.The approach (iv) in the analysis of the XANES spectra, i.e., the simulation using proper software, is generally more difficult and time-consuming. The simulations necessitate the use of a structural model, i.e., Cartesian coordinates of the atoms that comprise a cluster around the absorbing atom, which is either provided by other characterization techniques, e.g., diffraction techniques in crystalline materials or by theoretical calculations, e.g., molecular dynamicsAmong the abovementioned procedures, fitting of the spectrum with step function(s) and a number of peak functions permits (i) the quantification of defects from defectrelated states

Key Research Findings:
In the following, representative, recently published applications of the XAFS spectroscopy in various types of nanomaterials will be discussed.

Metallic and Intermetallic Nanomaterials:
Metal or intermetallic nanoclusters, supported, embedded, or self-standing, comprise an important class of materials since they have the potential for several applications including catalysis and magnetic recording media as well as due to their superior tribological and optical properties.

Metal Nanocatalysts:
Since the late 1970s, it was established that the catalytic activity increases significantly with increasing the surface area of the catalyst, thus driving their preparation in the form of tiny particles. A review on XAFS characterization of metallic and nonmetallic catalysts till late 1980s can be found in ▶ Chap. 8 of Ref.In addition to that, XAFS provides information on the oxidation state of the nanocatalyst which is related to chemical effects and charge transfer. The latter can be assessed from the position of the absorption edge and the position and intensity of the white line as well as from the EXAFS spectrum that allows for the detection of different kinds of neighboring atoms. Finally, time-resolved XAFS (Quick-XAFS) is Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells offer solutions in energy production with applications from electric vehicles to power plants. However, aging of the catalyst is an important issue. Witkowska et al. studied the effect of aging of Pt nanocatalysts supported on Vulcan (E-TEK) with XAFS measurements at the Pt-L 3edgeExcept from time-resolved studies applied for the investigation of the synthesis or aging processes, XAFS is also applied for the study of the structure of nanocatalysts. γ-Alumina-supported Pt nanoclusters with average particle size 0.8 nm were studied by means of Pt-L 3 -edge XAFSA method alternative to impregnation for the preparation of supported nanocatalysts is based on colloidal deposition. For the deposition of Pt on TiO 2 , the following procedure was followed: a Pt precursor was reduced to Pt nanoparticles in the presence of protecting polymers, then the nanoparticles were deposited on TiO 2 , and finally the polymers were decomposed and the Pt nanoparticles were reduced. Einaga et al.Dendrimer-encapsulated Au nanoparticles, with size ranging from 1 to 2 nm, were investigated using EXAFS in order to evaluate an analysis model that would take into account the asymmetry in the bond-length distribution. Encapsulation within a dendrimer template results in negligible interactions with the support. On the other hand, controlled disorder of the Au nanoparticle was achieved by different concentrations of thiols which are small molecules that penetrate easily the dendrimer and are strongly adsorbed on the particle surfaceMixed noble metal nanoparticles have a higher conversion rate and thus are expected to exhibit superior catalytic properties compared to the single component counterparts resulting in lower required loadings. Therefore, optimal performance in direct methanol fuel cells has been achieved using a bimetallic catalyst. Christensen et al.Except from the application of noble metals in catalysis, other metals are attractive for catalytic reactions as well. For example, Ni can be used in the CO 2 reforming of CH 4 , a reaction that finds applications in fuel cell technology as well as in the conversion of the greenhouse gases to a mixture containing H and CO. It also shows catalytic activity in reactions like hydrogenation of aromatic compounds and steam reforming reactions. Compared to noble metals, Ni has the advantage of higher abundance in nature. Higher catalytic activity is expected when the particle size is reduced to the nanoscale because the concentration of atoms with deficient coordination increases with decreasing volume-to-surface ratio. Wang et al.

Magnetic Metal Nanomaterials:
XAFS spectroscopy is extensively applied for the study of magnetic materials, both for the investigation of their nanostructure and for the determination of spin and orbital magnetic moments using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). For the acquisition of the XMCD signal, left-and right-handed circularly polarized SR light is utilized and the corresponding spectra, recorded in the presence of a magnetic field, are subtracted. The theoretical background of the XMCD and the so-called sum rules that can be used to extract information on the magnetic moments from the spectra can be found in Refs.Metallic nanoparticles exhibit a variety of magnetic phenomena, for example, super-paramagnetism, magnetoresistance, and magnetic anisotropy. Their properties depend strongly on several parameters such as their size, structure, and morphology, as well as on their chemical composition and interactions with substrates, matrices, and/or capping layers. Colloidal systems consisting of Co nanoparticles, with size of approximately 3 nm, embedded in surfactant matrices were studied by means of Co-K-edge XANES. The Co nanoparticles were prepared by Co 2+ reduction of cobalt bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate Co(AOT) 2 and cobalt bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate Co(DEHP) 2 reverse micelle solutionsBinary nanoalloys attracted a lot of interest because they allow tuning of the magnetic moments and magnetic anisotropy energy. CoPt clusters in the form of truncated octahedrons, with a diameter of approximately 3 nm, crystallized in the fcc structure, were studied through Co-K and Pt-L 3 -edge XAFS. Chemical ordering in the tetragonal L1 0 phase was achieved after proper annealingThe formation of CoPt alloys after thermal treatment of Co nanoparticles on PtFe-containing nanosized metallic systems are promising materials for magnetic recording, development of mini magnets, and biological applications. In binary metallic alloys, with low concentration of the magnetic element, scattering of conduction electrons due to magnetic impurities results in a characteristic temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity (Kondo effect). At higher concentrations of the magnetic element, coupling of the nuclear magnetic moments or the localized inner shell (d or f) electron spins through the conduction electrons occurs. At even higher concentrations, ferromagnetic-like coupling takes place resulting in superferromagnetic behavior. Nanogranular thin films of Fe 7 Au 93 , Fe 7 Ag 93 , and Fe 9 Cu 91 sputtered on Si, with granule size smaller than 10 nm, were studied by means of XMCD at the Au-L 2,3 -edge (at 5 K and room temperature) and with Fe-K-edge XANES (at 77 K)Decreasing of the metal nanoparticle size results in variation of their magnetic properties. Thus, although bulk Rh, that is, a 4d metal, is paramagnetic, Rh nanoparticles tend to be ferromagnetic. Furthermore, the magnetic moment is strongly affected by the number of the atoms that comprise the nanoparticle. Barthem et al.Magnetic proximity effects are phenomena that take place in heterostructures where the magnetic properties of the one layer control the properties of the other. Suturin et al.Gridneva et al.

Metal Nanoparticles for Optical Applications:
Metal nanoparticles embedded in transparent matrices, e.g., silica glass, have attractive linear and nonlinear optical properties based mainly on surface plasmon resonance. The formation of Ag nanoparticles in aqueous ethanol solution of PVP by photoreduction of AgClO 4 using benzoin as photoactivator was studied means of in situ time-resolved Ag-K-edge EXAFSIntermixing of Au and Ag for the formation of bimetallic Au-Ag nanoparticles was verified by EXAFS measurements at the Au-L 3 -edge since the backscattering amplitude of the Au is considerably different from this of Ag. Haug et al.The peculiar optical properties of metal nanoparticles lead to their use for decoration purposes in cultural heritage artifacts. Ag and Cu nanoparticles dispersed in a glassy matrix were used for coloring Medieval and Renaissance pottery. Padovani et al.

Semiconductor Nanostructures:
Semiconducting nanostructures, for example, quantum dots (QD), nanoparticles (NP), quantum wells (QW), nanowires, nanorods, and nanoribbons, attracted a lot of interest for microelectronic, spintronic, and photonic applications. QDs are nanoparticles with dimensions of a few nanometers which are smaller than the exciton Bohr radius. This results in strong quantum confinement of the electronic states which affects the value and type (direct/indirect) of the energy gap. XAFS is extensively applied for the study of strain, size, and alloying effects in the nanostructure and the electronic structure of the nanoparticles, the extent of intermixing the QDs with the substrate or capping layers, their interaction with agents used in their synthesis, for monitoring the synthesis processes by time-resolved measurements, and for the study of the magnetic properties in transition element diluted semiconductors. Examples on the application of XAFS for the study of semiconductor nanomaterials can be found in Ref.A large number of applications of nanosemiconductors rely on their optical emission properties which in turn depend on their electronic structure. As discussed in Sect. 3, the XANES spectrum is analogous to the partial density of empty states. Thus, in the case of semiconductors, XANES is a tool for the investigation of the density of states in the conduction band with orbital character determined by the selection rules [Eq. (4.8)]. A modification of XANES spectroscopy that is often employed in semiconductors is X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) spectroscopy, which is the X-ray analogue of photoluminescence. It studies the energy spectrum of the visible light emitted by the recombination of thermal electrons and holes (promoted to bottom of the conduction and top of the valence band, respectively) following the excitation with X-raysTo elucidate the origin of photoluminescence of Ge nanocrystals, Karatutlu et al.PdS QDs have potential applications in solar cells. The band gap of PbS is very sensitive to finite size effects (it takes values in the range 0.4-2.8 eV depending on the QD size) since the exciton Bohr radius is approximately 20 nm, a value considerably larger than in other nanoparticles. Demchenko et al.The use of ternary instead of binary semiconductors offers more flexibility for band gap engineering, since the gap can be controlled by either altering the size or the stoichiometry. On the other hand, the photoluminescence quantum yield of QDs is expected to increase when a thin layer with a higher band gap blankets the core, resulting in strong confinement. CdSe x S 1Àx QDs with size of 5 nm and 0 < x < 1 were studied through XAFS spectroscopy at the Cd-K-and Se-K-edgeAnother ternary alloy that was studied in the form of nanocrystals is Mg x Zn 1Àx O. Band gap engineering via control of the value of x results in materials with optoelectronic applications in the UV spectral region. However, in this case the end binary compounds, ZnO and MgO, crystallize in different structures, wurtzite and rocksalt, respectively. The bonding environment of Mg and Zn in Mg x Zn 1Àx O (0 < x < 1) nanocrystals was studied through XANES by Limpijumnong et al.The emission properties of ZnO-ZnS nanoribbons were studied with XANES at the Zn-K-and S-L 2,3 -edges employing the luminescence yield (emission in the visible spectrum) for the acquisition of the spectraSemiconductor nanowires are promising structures for various applications including memory, sensing, logic, light emission, and waveguiding. Segura-Ruiz et al.Incorporation of magnetic ions in semiconductor QDs has also attracted a lot of interest, since the magnetic properties due to orbital exchange can be further tuned by the size of the nanoparticle. Such diluted magnetic semiconductor QDs are attractive for spintronics, quantum computing, and magneto-optical applications. Ga 1Àx Mn x As is a ferromagnetic semiconductor with a Curie temperature of 191 K. Self-assembled Ga 0.92 Mn 0.08 As QDs with mean diameter of 16.5 nm, grown epitaxially on Si, were investigated using Mn-K-edge XANES spectroscopyMn-doped GaN nanowires were studied by means of Mn-K-edge XAFS and Mn-L 2,3 -XMCDThe incorporation of Cr 3+ ions in the lattice of ZnSe QDs was studied by means of Cr-L 2,3 -edge XANESFe-doped ZnO is another example of a diluted magnetic semiconductor. Zn 0.99 Fe 0.01 O nanorods synthesized by coprecipitation were studied by means of O-K-and Fe-L 2,3 -edge XANESFor better comparison, the energy scale was shifted by an amount equal to the energy of the absorption edge of each atom. The strong similarities between the spectra revealed that Co substitutes for Zn. Furthermore, the position of the absorption edge (which is the same with that of the thin film alloy) indicates that Co is divalent. The Zn-K-edge EXAFS spectra recorded at different spots in the wire did not exhibit differences and did not show evidence of significant structural disorder.Size reduction in semiconductor structures triggered peculiar phenomena like the observation of ferromagnetic behavior of nonmagnetic materials. This behavior has been attributed to symmetry breaking at the surfaces and the consequent modification of the electronic structure. ZnO nanoparticles with dimensions of 20 nm capped with different organic molecules (trioctylphosphine, dodecylamine, and dodecanethiol) were studied by means of XMCDZnO nanorods can be grown with a hydrothermal method using Zn acetate as a precursor and surfactant which is necessary for the modulation of the crystal morphology and size of the nanoparticlesA promising method for the synthesis of QDs is based on microorganisms due to the low-cost and environment-friendly character of the process. Fellowes et al.Semiconductor QDs are used for biological imaging as well. The stability of water soluble ZnO QDs with diameters 3 nm and 4 nm was investigated in vivo in oral epidermoid carcinoma cells by Zn-K-edge XANES

Metal Oxide Nanomaterials:
Metal oxides find numerous applications in catalysis, as electrodes for Li-ion batteries, for magnetic and biomedical applications, etc. XAFS spectroscopies are extensively applied for the determination of the oxidation state of the metal, of the coexistence of various phases in the sample, and for the site preference, e.g., tetrahedral or octahedral coordination.

Metal Oxides Used for Electrodes:
Sn-based nanomaterials are used as anode materials for rechargeable Li-ion batteries.Monodisperse and size tunable Sn/SnO x nanoparticles (with Sn core diameter in the range 10-20 nm and oxide shell thickness of 3 nm) were studied by means of Sn-Kedge XAFSLithium manganese oxides (LMO) comprise another family of oxides used for Li-ion batteries. Although nanostructured materials have a number of advantages, for example, shorter diffusion length and faster pathway for Li-ion transport, they also present certain disadvantages such as particle agglomeration and reduced packing density. To overcome such problems, hybrid materials with metal nanoparticles of 20-50 nm size were homogeneously dispersed in a CNT network. The samples were prepared by heating MnO 2 -coated CNT composite with appropriate amounts and concentrations of an aqueous LiOH solutionAnother metal oxide that has been proposed for applications in electrodes is GeO 2 . The Coulombic efficiency (defined as the amount of charge that exits the battery during the discharge cycle to the amount of charge that enters the battery during the charge cycle) of this oxide can be improved by adding metallic components. Kim et al.The Cu-K-and Ge-K-edge spectra of the CuGeO 3 electrode at the beginning of the process (point 1) revealed that the oxidation states of Cu and Ge were +2 and +4, respectively. As the lithiation process proceeded, Cu was reduced to its metallic state. Reduction of Ge occurred at a later stage. The XANES observations were supported by the EXAFS spectra. In the corresponding Fourier transforms, the evolution of the formation of Cu and Ge metals, at the expense of the corresponding oxides, was tracked from the intensity of the Cu-Cu (Ge-Ge) and Cu-O (Ge-O) peaks, respectively. Similar XAFS analysis revealed that during delithiation (points 6-10) Cu remained mainly in the metallic state, whereas Ge started to oxidize after point 8. It was proposed that the formation of the Cu metal nanoparticles promotes the oxidation of Ge, thus improving the Coulombic efficiency of the electrode.Layered double hydroxides (LDH) are described with the general formula The formation mechanism of MoO 2 nanorods, which are also used as electrodes, was studied with in situ Mo-K-edge XANES spectroscopy. A linear combination fit of the spectra obtained during the synthesis reaction with the spectra of the MoO 2 Cl 2 precursor and the final product yielded the ratio of the two phases. After 90 min, about 90 % of the precursor was converted to MoO 2Metal oxides can be combined with conducting polymers for the formation of composite electrodes. NiO-polypyrrole (PPy) nanocomposites were studied at the(1)(5)(5)(2)Normalized X-ray Absorption (a.u.) Normalized X-ray Absorption (a.u.) Ni-K-edge at various stages of the discharge/recharge cycleTiO 2 is another oxide with applications in Li-ion batteries. Zhou et al.

Oxide Catalysts:
Pure TiO 2 or doped with metallic ions finds applications in photocatalysis which has many applications, for example, in water splitting, organic pollutant scavenging, and antifouling. The size of the nanoparticles, their composition, and the presence of oxygen vacancies are important parameters for their photocatalytic function. TiO 2 is stabilized in three phases: rutile is stable for macroscopic crystals, while brookite and anatase can be stable in nanoparticles. The photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 was found to be dependent on the adopted phase and/or the formation of a mixture of two phases. C.-Yu Liao et al.Kityakarn et al.Enhancement of the photocatalytic efficiency of titanate nanotubes in dissolution of organic pollutants is improved with the addition of Cu dopants. R.-a. Doong et al.ZnO has a direct and wide band gap and thus finds applications in UV shielding. However, it also exhibits photocatalytic activity that hinders its applications in UV shielding. For example, it causes skin damage, deterioration of paints and plastics, and color fading in plastics and fabrics. It has been proposed that the photocatalytic activity of ZnO can be reduced by doping with Co. The bonding configuration of Co dopants in ZnO nanoparticles (with particle size 10-50 nm) and doping levels 0.25-5 at.% was studied by means of XAFSMnO 2 catalysts have potential applications for electrochemical water splitting that is a key step in the use of H 2 in energy storage. MnO 2 exists in a number of polymorphs that adopt layered or tunneled structures where the octahedra around Mn share corners and/or edges. Bergmann et al.ZrO 2 -CeO 2 substitutional solid solutions attracted interest due to their applications in three-way catalysts. ZrO 2 is added to inhibit the CeO 2 deactivation. On the other hand, the catalytic activity of the ceria-zirconia catalysts is improved with the interaction of noble metal phases. Acuña et al.The formation of PdO nanoparticles in the pores of various medium-or large-pore zeolites by Pd ion exchange and heating was reported by Park et al.Johnston-Peck et al.The results indicate that Ce exists in a reduced state not at the surface but probably near the ceriaÀtitania interface. Variations in the oxidation state of Ce in Pt-CeO x catalysts were also observed in the Ce-L 3 -edge XANESCu-Al-O x catalysts of the water-gas shift reaction in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells were studied for daily start-up/shut-down operation

Fe Oxides and Other Magnetic Nanoparticles:
Nanosized Fe oxides find various applications due to their magnetic, electronic, photonic, and optical properties. Magnetic nanoparticles have been a subject of intensive research because of their applications in nano-diagnosis and nanotherapy. Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) and maghemite (γ-Fe 2 O 3 ) have attracted particular interest because they are ferromagnetic and biocompatible while they can be easily removed from the body via natural routes. The chemical formula of Fe 3 O 4 is often written as (Fe 2 O 3 ) Á (FeO) in order to indicate the coexistence of Fe 3+ (which occupies tetrahedral and octahedral sites) and Fe 2+ (in octahedral coordination). In maghemite (γ-Fe 2 O 3 ), which also adopts the spinel structure, Fe 2+ is oxidized to Fe 3+ and the charge neutrality is maintained by the presence of vacancies in octahedral sites. α-Fe 2 O 3 (hematite) is a nonmagnetic allotropic form of trivalent Fe with rhombohedral crystal structure. One phenomenon that is observed in nanosized Fe oxides is the apparent oxidation of the magnetite nanoparticles. Corrias et al.Piquer et al.Surfactant effects on the morphological, structural, and magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles produced by coprecipitation were investigated by Filippousi et al.γ-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles coated with Cu were studied by means of Fe-and Cu-L 2,3edge XANESBulk NiO is an antiferromagnetic material. However, magnetic behavior is observed when the NiO particle size is reduced down to the nanoscale. NiO nanoparticles with size 2-10 nm were studied by means of Ni-K-edge XAFSAnother family of magnetic materials is the magnetic spinel ferrites which are described with the general chemical formula M x Fe 3Àx O 4 , where M=Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, or Zn. They have biological applications such as thermal activation therapy, hyperthermia, biosensing, drug delivery, and magnetic resonance imaging. Addition of other metals in the structure of Fe 3 O 4 allows for the modification of the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles. The distribution of the metal ions in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the spinel structure depends on the radii, the oxidation state, and the electronic configuration of the ions. Another important parameter that affects the properties of the nanoparticles is the inversion parameter, i, which is defined as the number of divalent cations in octahedral sites. Co-K-and Fe-K-edge EXAFS was applied for the study of silica-coated CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticlesCo-substituted ferrite nanoparticles with size 5-6 nm and Co content varying from 0 to 0.94 were studied by means of XAFSThe size effect on the structural properties of Mn ferrites has been also investigated using XAFS

Nanoceramics:
ZrO 2 -based ceramics exhibit excellent electrical and mechanical properties which are attributed to the small, usually in the nanoscale, grain size. Fábregas and Lamas

Nanocomposites:
Nanocomposites are multiphase materials where one of the phases has one, two, or three dimensions smaller that 100 nm. The mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal properties of the nanocomposites differ significantly from those of the constituent phases. In the following, representative applications of XAFS spectroscopies for the study of nanocomposites with improved mechanical, wear, and irradiation resistance and tribological properties will be discussed.Oxide dispersion-strengthened (ODS) ferritic steels, which contain high concentration of nanosized oxide particles, are characterized by enhanced resistance to irradiation and thus are promising materials for applications in nuclear technology, for example, in reactors and in the waste incineration process. They are also candidates for CO 2 -free production of hydrogen and other applications such as in corrosive environments under high temperatures. ODS ferrite steel samples with 0.25-0.5 wt% Y 2 O 3 were studied by He et al.Precipitation-hardened Al alloys find applications in the aircraft industry. Staab et al.Transition metal carbides find applications in wear-and oxidation-resistant protective coatings and in low-friction solid lubricants. The applications are based on the nanocrystalline/amorphous-C nanocomposite structure. Furlan et al.

Carbon-Based Nanomaterials Carbon nanomaterials, for example, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), fullerene, and nanodiamond films, have tunable optical, electronic, and mechanical properties and are attractive for the fabrication of micro-and optoelectronic devices, chemical sensors, composite materials, and medical implants, as well as in renewable energy and environmental technologies. Recently, graphene, a single layer of sp 2 bonded C, attracted a lot of interests as a promising material for the fabrication of the nextgeneration electronic devices. C-K-edge NEXAFS spectroscopy is widely applied for the study of carbon-based nanomaterials. Examples of such applications are discussed in the following.

Carbon Nanotubes:
Carbon nanotubes are hexagonal arrays of carbon atoms rolled in such a way to form long, thin, hollow cylinders. They can be single-walled (SWNT) or multi-walled (MWNT) with their length and diameter varying from few hundred nanometers to several microns and from 1 to few hundred nanometers, respectivelyThe electronic structure of the nanotubes is similar to that of graphite, and thus their C-K-edge NEXAFS spectra exhibit strong similarities (seeAnother important property of the CNTs that renders them suitable for applications is functionalization, i.e., the attachment of atoms, molecules, or aggregates on the surface of the tube which is otherwise chemically inert. Functionalization of the CNTs results in improvement of their dispersion in various matrices to form composite materials and expands their applications in nanoelectronics, hydrogen storage, bioengineering, etc. Depending on the required CNT properties for specific applications, different functionalization, obtained via different processing steps, is necessaryContrary to applications where functionalization is necessary, there exist a number of other applications where an increased inertness is important. For example, Brzhezinskaya et al.The hydrogenation efficiency of SWNTs and their potential for applications in H storage was accessed with C-K-edge NEXAFSAnother important issue in CNTs concerns their doping, i.e., the incorporation of atoms in the hexagonal lattice. It has been reported that nitrogen doping increases the CNT reactivity toward deposition of Pt nanoparticles for catalytic applications. N-doped CNTs were studied by means of C-K-edge NEXAFSIntercalation of various compounds is also possible in CNTs. Encapsulation of Co-phthalocyanine (CoPc) in CNTs was studied by Schulte et al.

Graphene and Graphene Oxide:
Angle-resolved C-K-edge NEXAFS is extensively used for the characterization of graphene. Zhang et al.Formation of interfaces between graphene and ultrathin dielectrics is important in a variety of microelectronic devices. However such interfacing may affect the transport properties of graphene. Schultz et al.Graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor and therefore doping is applied to achieve gap opening. n-and p-doped graphene is a promising material for applications in biosensing, Li-batteries, and fuel cellsCl doping was also investigated using C-K-edge NEXAFS. Cl, which is a p-type dopant, introduces a shoulder or a peak at approximately 0.8 eV below the π* resonanceHaberer et al. studied hydrogenated graphene (H-graphene)The effect of growth temperature on the structure of a few-layer graphene, grown by molecular beam epitaxy, was also investigated using C-K-edge NEXAFSTwo-dimensional graphene oxide (GO), exfoliated from oxidized graphite, exhibits a behavior similar to that of a wide-band gap semiconductor. GO-metal oxide nanocomposites are suitable materials for supercapacitor applications. Similar to the case of graphene, the NEXAFS spectra of GO exhibit angular dependence that allow for the determination of the orientation of the O-related defects which give rise to additional peaks. Resonances that appeared at 286.5, 288.7, and 289.6 eV were assigned to π* excitations of C-O, C=O, and -O-C-OH, respectivelyGraphene often results from the reduction of GO that can be exfoliated from oxidized graphite. Hydrothermal reduction of GO to graphene in the temperature range 120-180 C resulted in partial restoration of the sp 2 bonding and removal of oxygen-containing functional groups

Nanomaterials and the Environment:
The widespread applications of nanoparticles have raised considerable concern about potentially hazardous implications related to their release in the environment. On the other hand, a number of nanomaterials find important environment-friendly applications, e.g., for the removal of toxic elements from the environment, from the drinking water, or for the dissociation of toxic compounds.

Environmental Implications of Nanomaterials:
Zn-K-edge XAFS was applied in order to investigate the structural changes in ZnO nanoparticles after their release in the environment and interaction with phosphates CeO 2 nanoparticles, which are extensively used in biomedical applications, in cosmetics, as polishing materials, as well as in diesel-fuel additives, are considered toxic after their release in the environment. The biotransformation, i.e., biochemical modification by living organisms, of CeO 2 nanoparticles was studied by Zhang et al.Ce was found to retain the form of CeO 2 nanoparticles in soybean plants grown in CeO 2 -nanoparticle contaminated soil, while only a small amount was reduced to Ce 3+Ti-K-edge XAFS was used to study the accumulation and dissolution of TiO 2 nanoparticles, with diameters ranging from 14 to 655 nm, in wheat plantsRegarding the interaction of nanoparticles with tissues, Vaeronesi et al.

Nanosized Adsorbents of Toxic Elements:
Nanosized metal oxides are used for the adsorption of toxic elements, for example, As from drinking water. As in natural waters exists in the form of As 3+ and As 5+ . Trivalent As is considered as more toxic. The maximum allowed concentration of As in drinking water is 10 μg/l. Nanosized absorbents appear to be more effective compared to their macro-sized counterparts due to their large surface area. The ability of the adsorbents to oxidize As 3+ to the less toxic As 5+ and the trapping mechanism of As on the surface of the nanoparticles depend on the oxidation state of As, the chemical composition of the sorbent, and the solute pH. The As-K-edge XANES spectra (Fig.The efficiency of amorphous TiO 2 and TiO 2 nanoparticles, obtained by calcinations, in the adsorption of As was studied by Jegadeesan et al.The As 5+ trapping in magnetite nanoparticles was studied by means of absorption and precipitation methods[242] revealed that oxidation of As 3+ did not take place. Bidentate binuclear and monodentate mononuclear complexes were detected in the case of As 5+ with the relative concentration depending on the As loading. Regarding As 3+ , it was found that As forms dimmers of arsenite pyramids (As 2 O 5 ) which are bonded to the layers of the green rust. Starch-stabilized magnetite nanoparticles were used for As 5+ adsorptionSince As 3+ is more toxic than As 5+ , processes that enhance the transformation of As 3+ to As 5+ and/or As retention are of interest for the remediation of As-contaminated groundwater. As-K-edge XANES verified the oxidation of As 3+ to As 5+ from magnetite nanoparticles in the presence of O 2 . As 3+ oxidation under similar oxic conditions was also achieved with ferrihydrite nanoparticles but only after addition of an aqueous solution of Fe 2+Iron oxide nanoparticles have been also considered for the adsorption of other elements which are considered toxic above certain concentrations. The trapping mechanism of Se 6+ on maghemite nanoparticles was studied with XAFS measurements at the Se-K-edgeContamination of water resources by heavy metals, for example, Ni, Pb, and Hg, which are by-products of industrial activities, is also of great concern. Tinanate nanotubes (TNTs) were used for the removal of Ni 2+

Conclusions and Future Perspectives XAFS spectroscopy, carried out using synchrotron radiation beams with beam size that ranges from hundreds of micrometers to few tens of nanometers, is a unique tool for the study of a plethora of materials developed for nanotechnology applications. Although in most of cases the XAFS signal provides average information from a certain sample volume, it is a versatile and attractive technique because it is element specific and nondestructive; it does not rely on the long-range order, as diffraction techniques do; and it is able to obtain signal from small quantities of a variety of materials, e.g., liquids, solids, quantum structures, composites, complexes, diluted samples, and elements that span almost the whole periodic table.The multitude of information that can be obtained is related to symmetry, electronic properties, charge transfer and oxidation state, element-specific magnetic properties, bonding configuration of elements, finite size effects and disorder, chemical effects, etc.The development of quick-XAFS, with the improvement of acquisition electronics and detectors, offered the possibility to perform dynamical studies in the sub-second scale. The use of dispersive monochromator optics and CCD detectors permits measurements at even shorter time scales. When combined with proper sample environments for in situ characterization, unique information can be obtained on the dynamics of the material synthesis processes and the evolution of chemical reactions. Time-resolved measurements also permit the study of material response upon perturbation, for example, the application of external magnetic fields, laser light, mechanical stress, or mixing with a reactant. Time slicing is a relatively new method that offers sub-picosecond pulses of X-rays for the study of ultrafast phenomena.Although microspectroscopy techniques enable XAFS measurements and XRF imaging of inhomogeneous samples with beam size of about 1 μm, still the size of the beam is 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than the size of nanomaterials. Toward the improvement of the spatial resolution, spectromicroscopy techniques are developed, where the XANES spectra are reconstructed from X-ray microscopy images with spatial resolution of approximately 50 nm. These images are recorded at different energies that span the XANES spectral region of the element and edge of interest.Finally, the development of free electron lasers will improve dramatically the spatial and time resolution, thus enhancing the possibilities for advanced and intriguing XAFS-based methods for the study of nanomaterials of various kinds.  Much is still to be learned about the properties of these materials, however. At what point in cluster growth does a material change from the quantum behavior of a single atom or molecule to the ensemble behavior of a bulk metalHowever, a very brief introduction shall help the reader to understand the separation of the group of APNCs from the wider group of nanoparticles (NPs). The definition of NPs as mesoscopic systems between atoms or molecules and macroscopic bulk material can apply to a good number of structures with particle sizes of 100 nm. The term APNC means that these NPs have a precise number of atoms and generally implies that they are small (below 10 nm diameter). It is reported that the atomic precision of APNCs affects catalytic and optical properties and gives exceptional stability to the APNC (e.g.,The first step in understanding the correlation between the structure and the chemical and physical properties (which enable tailoring of the catalytic properties of the APNCThe most basic structural models were created on the basis of atomic packing structures (e.g., fcc) and are summarized by BenfieldThe most studied group among the APNCs is the gold clusters (Au x (SR) y ) with thiol capping. This is because when the gold-sulfur interface can be understood (including atomic and electronic structure, properties of signal transmittance, excitations, and electron transport), then they can be applied to fields such as nanocatalysis, molecular electronics, biolabeling, photonics, and sensingThe second step in the understanding of the physical and chemical properties (specifically the catalytic properties) of APNCs is the determination of their electronic properties, which depend on the basic structure (size, packing) and environment. In particular, the size of a cluster will determine whether its electronic properties are discrete, i.e., atoms, molecules, and small clusters or form a band structure, i.e., bulk metalsThe goal of the generation of APNC is not only the control of the size (e.g., number of atoms) but also the distribution of metals in the case of the bimetallic NC. The determination of the distribution of the two metals is another aspect of the concept of "active sites" which includes defects, sharp corners, and atomic steps, and its understanding can help control catalytic reactions furtherThe electronic properties can change if the two metals are distributed in the certain wayA powerful characterization technique for many materials is X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). XAS has become a very important tool among the synchrotronbased techniques for the characterization of materials, especially metal nanoparticles and catalysts• Determine coordination numbers (CN) to the neighboring atoms in a NC • Determine distances of Me-Me and Me-L bonding • Compare structure models with experimental data • Determine structural disorder (up to a degree) These important structural details can even be extracted from amorphous materialsUsing the other aspect of XAS, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES, formerly called NEXAFS) spectroscopy, it is possible to:• Analyze the electronic properties (i.e., density of electronic states above the Fermi level) • Determine the effective oxidation state • Determine the chemical speciation In this review, we focus on the methods and problems that are connected with the characterization of APNCs using XAS. Correct structural models and purity of NP content are the most important aspects to highlight. Together EXAFS and XANES are very versatile (nondestructive, study both atomic and electronic structure) and can be applied to the characterization of all kinds of materials and reactions in situ, even if they require high temperatures, high pressures, or other environmental changes, e.g., solvation and vaporizationSome questions that will be answered in this review are the following:• When was EXAFS first used for the characterization of APNC?• How is the atomic size (numbers of atoms) determined by using EXAFS?• What is so different in the use of EXAFS to study APNC compared to normal NP? • What is the effect of structural disorder on the EXAFS analysis technique?• How can the electronic information contained in XANES be extracted? This latest review focuses on the use of XAS to characterize the structure, electronic properties, and behavior of APNCs, including during heating, solvation, and catalytic activity.Other recent reviews on related topics include the following: Bare and ResslerIn the wide field of applications of EXAFS, theoretical methods especially the combination of EXAFS with other theoretical methods such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) are progressing fast and are becoming the state of the art of the characterization techniquesThe evolution of clusters from atomic to bulk including both theoretical and experimental discussions is found in SchmidFrenkelThe sections of this chapter are organized as follows: A short introduction of the physics of XAS and the specifics of XANES and EXAFS is followed by a discussion of the experimental setup in the next section. The main section of this chapter discusses the techniques of the application of first, EXAFS and second, XANES that are used in order to gain structural and electronic information from investigations of APNCs and the key findings.

Experimental and Instrumental Methodology

The Physics of X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a sophisticated tool to analyze many different types of materials. It is especially useful because no long-range order is required, but only the local environment of the element of interest is significant. This qualifies XAS as an excellent tool for the investigation of noncrystalline systems.The analysis of XAS spectra can give details on oxidation state, geometry, and the kinds of neighboring atoms. The element under investigation can be chosen because of the distinct electron binding energies. There are a number of introductory texts on XAS available in the literature, for example, Bunkerð Þx(5:1)describes the attenuation of radiation of initial intensity I 0 with regard to intensity I at a distance x within a material. μ l (E) (short, μ) is the linear absorption coefficient at energy E. For XAS experiments, bonding energies of inner shell electrons extend from UV light for light elements (%50 eV) up to hard X-rays (%100 keV) for heavy elements. In this typical energy range for XAS experiments, the absorption coefficient μ is dominated by the photoelectric effect. XAS involves the measurement of the absorption coefficient μ as a function of photon energy E close to the ionization energy of an inner shell electron in a material and reveals a fine structure (see Fig.

XANES:
The fine structure of the near-edge (XANES, earlier NEXAFS) spectra consists of distinct characteristics such as pre-edge peaks, a white line (WL), shape resonances (SR), and the energy position of the absorption edge E 0 (cf. Fig.Additional information contained in the XANES spectrum comes from the correlation of the WL feature to molecular orbitals and density of statesHere, E is the photoelectron energy, and ρ 0 (E) is the density of states for the atomic backgroundTo correlate the unoccupied l-DOS ρ(E) with experimental XANES, the relationcan be used, where μ 0 (E) describes the effects of the core-hole interaction. In general, unoccupied states show up as peaks (reflecting possible transitions between molecular orbitals), and hybridization of orbitals is revealed when peaks in different orbitals have the same energy

EXAFS:
More than 50 eV up to 1000 eV above the absorption edge (E 0 ), the fine structure is much reduced in intensity but not reduced in information content. Therefore, in order to extract the information, the smooth atomic background has to be removed, and χ(E), the fine structure function (Fig.where μ(E) is the measured absorption coefficient, μ 0 (E) is the atomic background (a function calculated as a spline), and Δμ(E) is the edge step. Further, this function of the oscillations is converted into k-space using k 2 = 2 m/ђ 2 (E À E 0 ) (with m, the mass of the electron, and ђ, the Planck constant (over 2π)) and using Fourier transformation into R-space (Fig.

The interference between initial and backscattered waves as well as some examples for scattering paths is visualized in Fig.The EXAFS function χ(k) is directly connected to the parameters of the environment of the absorbing atom. These parameters are described in the EXAFS equationAt present, EXAFS data are analyzed by refining the theoretically calculated EXAFS spectra of single paths using the sum of path rule:where χ P denotes each path contributing to the spectrum.The modern analysis of EXAFS data is done with programs such as Artemis (Demeter/Ifeffit)For the EXAFS fitting approach for NP, the following constraints have been proposed previously1. The degeneracy of multiple scattering paths has to be optimized within a range obtained by the measured size distribution of the nanoparticles. 2. Due to the presence of surface, i.e., ill coordinated, atoms in NP systems, the bond distance and bond-angle distributions are affected; therefore, it must be possible to determine the bond distances separately from the bulk metal system. 3. Because the background is the same as in bulk crystalline metal foil, nonstructural parameters are fixed to the values obtained for bulk metal within their estimated uncertainty (S O 2 , ΔE 0 ).The EXAFS analysis of bimetallic APNCs is even more challenging1. The CNs (N Me1-Me2 and N Me2-Me1 are heterometallic coordination numbers) of the Me-Me bonds for the two different metals (Me1 and Me2) have to relate to their concentration c:The distances R between atoms of the two metals in each shell have to be the same: R Me1ÀMe2 ¼ R Me2ÀMe1 . 3. The disorder parameters (Debye-Waller factor, σ 2 ) for both metals in each shell have to be the same:

The XAS Experiment:
Synchrotron radiation is monochromatized using a set of parallel crystals in a double crystal monochromator applying Bragg's law:with n being the order number, λ the wavelength of the reflected light, d the spacing of the crystal, and θ the Bragg angle. Slits are used to collimate and mirrors to focus the incoming beam onto the sample position.A double crystal monochromator with parallel crystal setup is preferred for XAS experiments because the incoming and exiting beams are parallel to each otherAfter monochromatizing, the photons pass through the two ionization chambers and the sample to measure μ(E). For concentrated samples, the absorption μ can be measured indirectly by applying the law of Lambert-Beer (cf. Eq. 5.1)transmission mode:The absorption coefficient μ(E) is determined by measuring the photon current before the sample (I 0 ) and behind the sample (I 1 ). If another ionization chamber (I 2 ) is installed behind I 1 , a standard (e.g., metal foil) can be measured at the same time with the sample. This standard is used for energy calibration purposes. Diluted samples with less than 1 % concentration of the absorbing element are measured in fluorescence mode where the semiconductor detector collects the fluorescence photons (I f ) that are emitted as response to the absorption of the incident beam (I 0 ) by the sample. Fluorescence and Auger electrons are the two relaxation mechanisms of atoms excited by X-ray radiation. For fluorescence detection, the absorption coefficient μ(E) is described byEquation 5.9 is an approximation and only valid if the sample is thin and diluted so that no self-absorption occurs. Also, the sample should face in the direction of 45 with respect to the incoming beam (and therefore also the semiconductor detector)The sample preparation can have significant effects on the measurement. It is important that the samples are of the right average thickness and are homogeneous. The thickness of the sample determines the total absorption, which ideally should be about 1. Homogeneity of the sample is important because a nonhomogeneous sample will have a distribution of absorption coefficients instead of a wellcharacterized single value. As discussed by Lee et al.

Key Research Methods and Findings on APNCs Characterized Using XAS

EXAFS:
The EXAFS analysis method is very important for the characterization of metal clusters and catalysts. EXAFS analysis is used to determine specific information about materials including the chemical identity, average bond lengths for the different shells, and ensemble-average CN of atoms in each shell around a central atom.To date, only APNCs containing Au, Pd, Pt, and some alloys (e.g., Au-Cu, Au-Pd, and Au-Pt) have been characterized by EXAFS. The literature reporting EXAFS used for the characterization of APNCs together with the details of the EXAFS analyses is summarized in Table

Simple Structural Models:
The first reports of the characterization of APNCs with EXAFS, i.e., Au 55 clusters made by the SchmidIn another early approach, Benfield et al.This technique using the CNs of the first shell of the EXAFS analysis comparing to the fcc model was typically used in early EXAFS analyses

Coordination Number Truncation:
The coordination number truncation model (CNT) demonstrates that atoms on the surface of the particle are surrounded by fewer neighbors than those in the bulk, and, hence, the average coordination number of the first nearest neighbors decreases

Surface Tension:
The surface-tension (ST) model was developed by Mays et al.Contraction of the first-shell Au-Au distance was observed by Menard et al.

Self-Consistent Analysis:
Frenkel et al.Using these two methods (CNT and ST), Frenkel et al.Frenkel and coworkers also used this self-consistent model investigating the geometry of Au 13 NCs capped with mixed ligandsHowever, these studies show the importance of using several models for the characterization of APNCs because each method includes some disadvantages.

Synergy of Multiple Techniques: The Use of Complementary:
Experimental Methods There are many different techniques for the characterization of materials, such as TEM (transmission electron microscopy), UV-vis (optical spectroscopy), FTIR (Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy), XAS, XPS, MALDI-MS (matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry), theoretical calculations, and others. It is desirable when possible to use more than one of these techniques for the characterization of APNCs, especially when XRD, which is the major tool for structure determination, is not applicable. In some cases, the different methods complement each other and increase the level of understanding of the system, while in other cases, the results can confirm each other or point out possible problems.Weir et al.In the work of Simms et al.Multiple techniques were used by Menard et al.Using HRTEM electron diffraction techniques, Menard et al.Frenkel et al.Vargaftik et al.Benfield et al.In other cases

Combining:
One central feature to the structure of Au x (SR) y NCs is the so-called staple motif (Fig.Because there are different sites for the Au atoms in the Au x (SR) y NCs, theoretical investigations (by MacDonald et al.Site-specific EXAFS simulations using the structure model of Au 25 (SR) 18 cluster, proposed by Qian et al.Chevrier et al.Exchanging the thiolate ligands for selenolate ligands, the structure of Au 25 (SeR)Next to the Au-S shell, two Au-Au shells could be determined from the experimental EXAFS analysis. Again the CNs were fixed from the theoretical model, in this case a Au 28 fcc core with 12 bridging and 8 Au atoms in staple motifs. For the first shell of Au-Au bonding, a much shorter distance compared to the Au 38 cluster was observed. This experimental EXAFS data (see Fig.In another investigation, solely theoretical considerations of Au 25 and Au 102 NCs using site-specific EXAFS and l-DOS calculations were reported by Christensen et al.

The Relationship of DFT-MD Calculations and DFT Bases EXAFS Calculations:
In another step to enhance the quality of EXAFS analysis and modeling, Yancey et al.The EXAFS analysis shows that the CNs for Au-Au decrease and for Au-S increase when the surface density of thiols increases. This decrease in Au-Au CN with increasing surface density of thiols is in agreement with other results reported for disordered nanoparticle systems (e.g., Myers et al.Among their results, Yancey et al.

In Situ EXAFS:
Fast scanning techniques make it possible to observe reactions with EXAFS as they proceed (in situ). The strategic approach of using in situ EXAFS for temperature and extensive catalysis experiments consists of (1) gathering basic structural information about the system using EXAFS and (2) correlating this knowledge with chemical and structural changes of the APNCs during catalytic reactionsWu et al.While UV-vis, MALDI-MS, and HAADF-TEM were used to confirm the successful synthesis and loading on CeO 2 rods, the CO oxidation treatment was investigated in situ with MS, FTIR, Raman, XAS spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. In this reportThe structure of Pt 240 DENs (on electrode support) during electrocatalytic oxidation of CO was investigated with in situ EXAFS, UV-vis, XPS, and TEM by Weir et al.Myers et al.

Bimetallic APNCs:
Bimetallic APNCs are discussed in Knecht et al.Anderson et al.Another approach based on site-specific structural considerations (such as in section "The Relationship of DFT-MD Calculations and DFT Bases EXAFS Calculations") can only be applied on very small NCs with only one doping atom. Investigations on Au 24 Pt(SR) 18 are reported by Christensen et al.Site-specific EXAFS simulations together with Mössbauer and EXAFS spectroscopy were used by Negishi et al.

EXAFS Analysis Is Not a Black Box:
EXAFS analysis has a steep learning curve which is obvious if one watches the instruction videos or attends an EXAFS training workshop. The fitting technique using the analysis software is not "intuitive." At the same time, it is not enough to just press some buttons and the result is given. In these fast times where too much stress is laid on the number of publications, there seems to be not enough time to learn this technique by training to fit already-understood data. In this following section, a couple of problems are discussed to point out the difficulties of an EXAFS analysis that are rarely discussed.

Variety of Capping Ligands:
One problem in the characterization of APNC by applying EXAFS fitting analysis, which is discussed in Menard et al.The scattering amplitudes and phases that are calculated from theory (specifically by use of crystal structures of bulk compounds as an input for the FEFF calculations) are equivalent for elements such as P, S, Cl

The Effect of Structural Disorder:
Within the EXAFS data analysis technique as can be seen from the EXAFS equation (Eq. 5.5), structural disorder is parameterized in the form of the Debye-Waller factor (σ 2 ) (e.g., CalvinThe effects of static structural disorder beyond the Gaussian case that are correlated to symmetric bond length distributions in the NCs are due to different bond Reprinted from FairbanksIn the reports by Frenkel et al.

The Importance of the k-Range and the Limitations of the Resolution of EXAFS:
The limitations of the resolution of the EXAFS analysis are discussed in the report by Menard et al.As a positive example where subshells could be observed in the experimental EXAFS spectra, the report by MacDonald et al.The Requirement of Sample Purity Menard et al.The effect of mixed samples on EXAFS analysis is discussed extensively by Frenkel and coworkers, specifically in

Experimental XANES and the Fingerprint Analysis:
The measurement of XANES spectra can take less time than the measurement of EXAFS spectra, and more noise is acceptable for the data analysis using the fingerprint method (see Sect. 3.2). In order to gain structural information using the fingerprint method, effort has to be taken to find adequate reference spectra. In the case of APNCs, this is not always possible. In the studies when XANES data of APNCs have been reported, they were mainly shown compared with the bulk metal data (e.g.,Another useful approach was reported by Frenkel et al.Only in the report by Benfield et al.Even though not precisely about APNCs, Ohyama et al.However, caution must be applied when dealing with small differences. Although experimental XANES spectra are usually less affected by noise (because of the much more intense nature of the WL and SR) than EXAFS spectra, both EXAFS and XANES spectra always contain experimental errors that must be considered when making conclusions from the data. Firstly, there is an experimental error in the energy (E). If the energetic position of a peak maxima/minima (e.g., WL) or edge E 0 differs by more than the minimum step size (which was used for the measurements), this difference is significantL 3 -edge XANES measurements are usually reported for transition metals such as Au and Pt. The L 3 -edge XANES spectra for these elements probe the transition 2p ! 5d 5/2 (or 6 s). Correspondingly, for the L 2 -edge, the transition 2p ! 5d 3/2  (6 s) is probed as discussed in Sect. 3.2. For the transition metals Au and Pt, the L 3,2edge spectra are quite sensitive to electronic changes of the d-band which is especially observed in the WL region. These changes directly correlate to the oxidation state and d-band population of the material. In transition metals such as Pt and Au, the 5d-bands are filled in the metal state, and the XANES spectra (at L 3,2edges) of these metals do not have a WL. For example, in the case of Au(III) compounds (with oxidation state 3+), the WL increases drastically due to the decrease in the occupancy of the d-orbitals (as d-electrons are transferred to the ligand) (Fig.In order to extract significant information from the shape (e.g., intensity differences of the WL) of the XANES spectrum, several methods intending to estimate densities of unoccupied 5d states around the Fermi level have been developed. These approaches do not just use the comparison of the intensity of the WL per se but the comparison of the intensity of the absorption edge calculated as the area under the peakIn Benfield et al.

Theoretical XANES, l-DOS Calculations, and Charge Transfer:
In a number of reportsWithout getting into much detail about the theory, which is covered by the literature (e.g.,Using the FEFF code to get a XANES spectrum is not too difficult. However, if something that looks somewhat like (the) data is calculated (and electron counts and l-DOS is calculated in any case), it is important to test its validity. These tests would include:• Convergence of the SCF calculations (to determine the stability of the Fermi energy and thus electron transfer) • Convergence of the full multiple scattering calculations (to determine the necessary cluster size) • Agreement with the experimental data (to determine the validity of the cluster used and thus the l-DOS curves)For typical compounds, it has been shown that 5-6 shells of atoms around the absorbing atom are required for a multiple scattering calculations in the full multiple scattering module so that the cluster can reproduce a XANES spectrum for that compoundThe development of XANES features for small Au clusters was studied by Chen et al.However, in the above report by Chen et al.There are discrepancies between experiment and FEFF calculations that are due to approximations. This fact is known, and the need for improvement of the FEFF code for XANES calculations is discussed by the developers of FEFF (e.g.,To better understand the following discussions about l-DOS and charge transfer, some basics about Au are mentioned first. The electronic structure of Au was reported by Coulthard et al.MacDonald et al.L-DOS and charge transfer calculations can be complemented with XPS and can extend the understanding of electronic propertiesSite-specific d-and s-electron occupancy was used by MacDonald et al.Chevrier et al.

Conclusion and Future Perspectives:
The quite young field of atomically precise nanoclusters started in the 1980s and was first addressed by the technique of EXAFS in 1985The EXAFS strategies that were developed for the characterization of NP can be applied similarly to APNCs. However, improvements in EXAFS, such as the CNT model or the surface-tension model, were necessary due to the small size of the NCs. One important feature of all nanoparticle investigations is that the amplitudes of the EXAFS signals (in k-space and R-space) of the nanoparticles compared to the bulk metal are always reduced and in XANES even broadened. It has been shown that a self-consistent approach for the EXAFS analysis, using different models within the same technique, is a good method in order to validify the results characterizing the NCs.Since XAS is a technique based on the average configuration of the sample under investigation, disorder within this configuration (more precisely disorder in the structure due to different bond distances) can lead to EXAFS analysis results that can be misleading.XANES and EXAFS are not black boxes where a button just has to be pressed to measure the samples and spit out the results. Some understanding of the underlying physics of both methods (which includes an understanding of the errors involved) and a deeper understanding of the methods which are the basis of the technique have to be developedThe techniques and methods that are presented here give a brief overview of the models that EXAFS analysis can use and how XANES and l-DOS calculations can be applied.The application of complementary techniques (including HRTEM and HAADF-STEM to determine size homogeneity) is important to help validify the EXAFS results. Even more so can theoretical calculations using different techniques (DFT-EXAFS, DFT-MD) help to determine effects of structural disorder on the EXAFS analysis of experimental spectra.The extraction of electronic information about APNCs from XAS can be done through L-DOS calculations based on FEFF. However, this has to be set in perspective with previous DOS calculations or XPS results to make proper analyses.In conclusion, we find that a number of groups are using XAS techniques, especially EXAFS analysis for the characterization of APNCs. These reports are not just about understanding the structure of the NCs any longer but more so about tuning the properties of these NCs by varying the ligands. A particular driving force in these reports has been the understanding of the effect of the staple motif. EXAFS is a very powerful tool to study the changes in structure including bond length, coordination environment, and disorder that can be examined very powerfully. This use of the XAS toolbox (theoretical, experimental, in situ EXAFS and XANES, and l-DOS calculations) in its variety does help to gain more accurate information about the structural and electronic properties of APNC and their catalytic application.Further improvements in the application of EXAFS/XANES in the characterization of APNCs lie in the development of reactors that can be installed in the XAS beamline to collect X-ray absorption spectra in situ as temperature and pressure are varied or other environmental conditions are needed or to observe the synthesis or a catalytic reaction itself. Such reactors to observe the synthesis can be, for example, milli-fluidic reactors (e.g.,Summarizing, we find that EXAFS and XANES are exciting and versatile techniques in the study of APNCs and their use in catalysis. The analysis of XAS data can be quite challenging, however, and it is important to have a thorough knowledge of the physics and possible sources of error involved and, in many cases, combine the EXAFS and XANES analyses with other techniques, and theoretical modeling, to produce the best understanding of the system under investigation.

Overview:
The chapter describes operation principles of x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) technique and its application to atomic arrangement in nanoparticles, with a special interest in electrochemistry.XAS is a nondestructive technique that measures the changes in x-ray absorption coefficient of a material as a function of energy. X-rays of a narrow energy resolution are shone on the sample, and the incident and transmitted x-ray intensity are recorded as the incident x-ray energy is incremented. When the incident x-ray energy matches the binding energy of an electron of an atom within the sample, the number of x-rays absorbed by the sample increases dramatically, causing a drop in the transmitted x-ray intensity; this is referred to as an absorption edge. Each element has a set of unique absorption edges giving XAS element selectivity. Because it requires a tunable x-ray source, XAS spectra are usually collected at synchrotrons. The x-rays are highly penetrating and allow studies of gases, solids, or liquid at concentrations of as low as a few ppm. When applied to nanoparticles, the technique can resolve inner arrangement of atoms within. XAS can be separated into two parts, depending on the range it covers with respect to the absorption edge, i.e., x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (XANES and EXAFS).As it is element specific, XANES can resolve the oxidation state of the element, as well as its coordination environment and subtle changes in it. EXAFS analyzes the local structure of the atoms in all physical states (solid, liquid, and gas), but the unique power of the spectroscopy is found in metal clusters, particularly in nanomaterials. It can resolve the inner structure of the nanoparticle clusters composed of two or more elements, i.e., solid solution, aggregate mixtures, or core-shell particle in which one metal is present mostly in the center of the particle (core) and the other forms a shell around it. These nanoparticle systems are of a special interest in catalytic electrochemical oxidation and/or reduction, as most of these systems require expensive noble metals and minimizing their content is the goal of the present technology development. Since the atoms in the core of the particle are not exposed to the electrochemical environment, they can be substituted by non-noble materials. This chapter deals with electrochemical catalysts composed of two or more metal atoms and shows the basics of the analysis of these systems. Introduction While catalytic oxidation or reduction of species in electrochemistry involves the surface of the catalyst, there are a limited number of techniques that can study the catalyst surface during the electrochemical potential excursion, i.e., in situ. Vacuum techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) are ideal for probing the solution/surface interface, but can only be used before and after the catalytic process. In situ electrochemical techniques like infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy can reveal species adsorbed on the surface and/or in solution, but provide limited insight on the changes of the catalyst. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is an ideal method for in situ studies of electrochemical systems because both the solution and the catalyst can be probed by penetrating x-rays. The technique yields both structural and chemical information. Since it is element specific, XAS permits investigation of the chemical environment of a constituent element in a composite material such as alloy catalysts. The chemical environment of the constituents can be studied by tuning the beam energy to the specific absorption edge of the element. Unlike x-ray diffraction (XRD) that probes the long-range order of atoms in the sample and therefore cannot yield information of nanoparticles smaller than ca. 3 nm, XAS probes the shortrange order, and it can provide structural information on nanoparticles of practically any size. It can be also used to study amorphous materials, liquids, gases, adsorbed monolayers, and hydrated ions and complexes in aqueous solution or in dilute systems.XAS is also sometimes called x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), where the fine structure refers to the details on the absorption of x-rays by an atom at energies in the vicinity of the core-level energy of the atom. Its spectra are especially sensitive to the formal oxidation state and coordination chemistry of absorbing atom, as well as the distances, coordination number, and nature of species in its immediate surroundings. XAS is routinely used in a wide range of scientific fields, including biology, environmental science, catalyst research, and material science. One major advantage of XAS in the study of electrocatalysts is its ability to probe the d states of Pt catalysts. The technique and its applications have been described in books, review articles, and online tutorials

X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy: Interaction with Matter:
Matter interacts with x-ray light by the photoelectric effect. An atom in its ground state absorbs the x-ray energy and ejects an electron (called "photoelectron") from the atom's inner shell (K, L, or M) into continuum, Fig.In XAS, K transition, or "K-edge," corresponds to the ejection of an electron from 1s subshell. By the same principle, L 1 edge corresponds to the excitation of an electron from 2s subshells. Transitions L 2 and L 3 correspond to the ejection of an electron from the 2p subshells. There are two transitions as the orbital momentum (l) and the spin momentum (s) are coupled to give j = l À s (for transition L 2 ) or j = l + s (transition L 3 ). The selection rules of x-ray absorption determine that in dipole transitions the orbital quantum number of the final state must differ by 1 from the initial state (Δl = AE1, i.e., transition s ! p, p ! s, p ! d, etc.), whereas the spin must be conserved (Δs = 0). The same system of labeling is used for transitions from higher shells, e.g., M 1 edge corresponds to the excitation of 3s electrons, M 2 and M 3 edges correspond to the transition of 3p electrons, and M 4 and M 5 correspond to the transition of 3d electrons. The K and L edges are mostly used in XAS.

XAS Techniques: EXAFS and XANES:
X-ray absorption spectroscopy refers to the modulation of the x-ray absorption coefficient at energies near and above an x-ray absorption edge. The term "edge," While there is no sharp boundary in the energy ranges corresponding to XANES and EXAFS spectroscopies, it is usually considered that XANES spans from a few tens of eV below the edge up to about 50 eV above the edge, while EXAFS covers a wide energy region (as much as 1.5 keV) that extends from 50 eV above the edge, as shown in Fig.The difference between the two spectroscopy techniques arises due to the processes that happen in the different energy ranges. It can be explained in terms of the relationship of the photoelectron wavelength λ and the interatomic distance R between the atom that interacts with the x-ray photon (photoabsorber) and the nearby atom (backscatterer). The photoelectron kinetic energy depends on the incident photon energy hν and the electron binding energy in the atom:where h is the Planck's constant in ħ = h/2π, and m is the mass of the photoelectron.For high E kinetic , the photoelectron wavelength is shorter than the interatomic distance, and the EXAFS region corresponds to a single scattering process; conversely, for lower energies, λ is larger than R and the XANES region is associated with a multiple-scattering regime. XANES is often used in material science and engineering to resolve structure of layered materials and can be used to identify both surface and undersurface monolayers based on different core-level energies of different elements, unlike vacuum surface science techniques (AES and XPS) that are sensitive to surface only. XANES is also sensitive to the chemical state of elements which can be present even in minute quantities and gives the information on valence state of the element, its coordination environment, as well as geometrical distortions of it. XANES is mostly used in fingerprinting of sample mixtures by linear combination analysis (LCA) if the components are known or to acquire the information of the principal components in the mixture by principal component analysis (PCA), if the components are unknown.EXAFS provides evidence on atomic arrangements, bond lengths, and coordination numbers in much the same way as XRD and LEED. EXAFS finds applications in all areas of science such as chemistry (e.g., in catalysis to distinguish catalytic steps and intermediate states in a complex reaction and catalytic active sites), physics (e.g., in solids, to resolve structure of alloys and amorphous/disordered solids, as well as phase transformations), materials science and engineering, structural biology, pharmaceutical industry, environmental science, etc.

Theoretical Interpretation of EXAFS:
Due to complexity of the multiple-scattering events, no simple equation that characterizes the XANES region has been described yet. On the other hand, deriving the EXAFS equation is relatively simple. It is based on the single-particle theory approximation, in which the system is separated into a single electron residing in the core levels of the selected atomic species that is excited by the x-ray photon and N-1 passive electrons. As x-ray passes through a material of a thickness t, its intensity exponentially decreases from the initial value I 0 to the value I in a way similar to the absorption of the UV/VIS radiation described by the Beer-Lambert law:The absorption coefficient of the material μ depends on the energy E of the x-ray radiation, as well as on the properties of the material, i.e., its atomic number Z, atomic mass A, and density ρ, as:Since the properties of the material are independent on the x-ray energy, the absorption coefficient smoothly decreases with the increase of energy of the x-rays; however, at absorption edge the absorption coefficient rises sharply (see Fig.If the photoabsorbing atom were completely isolated, i.e., not in any kind of environment, the sudden rise in absorption coefficient would be followed with the smooth decrease in the μ À E plot, according to Eq. 6.2. However, in condensed phases the electron wave travels to the neighboring atom (backscatterer) and reflects off of it, and the backscattered wave interferes with another wave coming from the photoabsorber; this interference produces oscillations in the μ(E) pattern as in Fig.where the bare atom background μ 0 (E) was subtracted out and divided with the edge step Δμ 0 (E 0 ) to produce oscillations in χ(E) normalized to one absorption event.Instead of the energy E of the photoelectron, it is more convenient to express the EXAFS oscillations as a function of photoelectron wave number k:where m is the mass of the photoelectron, E 0 is the energy of the edge, and h is the Planck's constant in ћ = h/2π. For E in eV, k = 0.512). Because the oscillations in χ(k) quickly diminish, χ(k) is often multiplied by k 2 or k 3 to lies outside the energy range of the plot. In contrast, the spectrum of a heavy atom like Pb contains multiple edges, i.e., five M edges around 3 keV which are too close to be resolved, three L edges around 12 keV, and a K-edge at 88 keV amplify the oscillations at higher k values. This is called k-weighting, and the plot shown in Fig.The EXAFS equation has been first derived by Edward SternA real system has neighboring atoms at different distances to the absorbing atom and of different nature, and they all contribute to the oscillations in χ(E), and all those scattering events are summed. In every scattering event, the amplitude factor of Eq. 6.5 depends on the distance to the backscatterer atom R and the coordination number N of identical backscatterers, as well as the amplitude reduction factor S 0 2 ; these factors are taken to be independent on the x-ray beam energy. In addition, the amplitude linearly depends on the probability that the scattering takes place at the nearby atom, f j (k). The phase shift δ j (k) is the consequence of the photoelectron moving in a varying potential induced by both central and backscattering atoms, i.e., with higher speeds around the atoms than in the space between them. Both f j (k) and δ j (k) depend on the photon energy (or wave number k) and on the nature of the scattering atoms. As Z increases, peaks in f(k) slowly shift toward higher k; for scatterers heavier than 3d transition elements, f(k) shows multiple peaks, which in turn split peaks in the magnitude of Fourier transform even when only a single absorber-scatterer are present, as shown in the case of Pt below.Besides the above parameters, there are additional semiempirical factors that affect the oscillations in the χ(k) plot. The term exp(À2R j /λ(k)) represents the probability that the photoelectron traverses the distance 2R from the photoabsorber factor and allows for both static and thermal disorder of the condensed system due to the mean square variation in distance σ j 2 . The two exponential terms affect the χ(k) such that inelastic losses diminish the amplitude of the sine wave at low values of k, whereas the Debye-Waller disorder factor dampens the amplitude at high k values.The amplitude reduction factor S 0 2 accounts for the losses in EXAFS amplitude due to many-electron excitations at the absorbing atom, thus representing the probability that each of the passive electrons surrounding the excited one remains in its initial state. While S 0 2 is generally taken to be a constant (typical values are within 0.7-1) for a certain element, it is actually energy dependent.

Experimental and Instrumental Methodology:
For a good XAS spectrum, the signal to noise (S/N) ratio should be better than a thousand. In order to obtain such a spectrum in a reasonable time (several minutes), an intense beam of the order of 10 10 photons/s and a bandwidth of about 1 eV are essential; these requirements are only met with synchrotron sources. Fortunately, there are several tens of synchrotron sources around the worldA typical XAS setup is shown in Fig.If the transmission experiment is not practical, e.g., when the sample concentration is too low, or the sample is too absorbing or too thick, the x-ray fluorescence signal I f can be monitored by means of a fluorescence detector. In that case, the absorption coefficient is directly proportional to the fluorescence: μt / I f . A number of fluorescence detectors are available, including semiconductor detectors like passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS), solid-state array detectors (Ge or Si), as well as an ion chamber fluorescence x-ray detector with Stern-Heald slit assembly, also known as the Lytle detector. For the fluorescence measurement, the sample and the detector are oriented at 45 and 90 with respect to the incoming beam (Fig.XAS measurements are usually done at K-edge up to about 40 keV, which includes low-Z elements of the first and second row of transition metals. Most synchrotron sources have the maximum of the photon flux near 10 keV; the flux at higher energies is reduced, sometimes by orders of magnitude, rendering measurements above 40 keV impractical. For third row transition metals, K-edge is too high, so measurements are usually conducted at L 3 edge. For instance, Pt K-edge is around 78 keV, while L edges are within 11-14 keV. The lowest-laying L 3 edge is mostly used as the probability (and therefore the intensity) of L 3 ; transition is much higher than that of other L edges.In the dipole approximation, the transition is restricted by the selection rule Δl = AE1 and Δj = 0, AE1, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number and J is the total angular momentum quantum number j ¼ l AE 1 = 2 . In the case of Pt, the L 2 absorption edge is associated with transitions to empty s 1/2 and d 3/2 states above the Fermi level. The L 3 edge corresponds to transitions to empty s 1/2 , d 3/2 , and d 5/2 states. The contribution of s-symmetric final states is normally small and is spread over a wide energy range, whereas the d-symmetric portion of the density of final states is large and confined to a narrow energy range. Assuming no significant hybridization, the L 2 edge probes empty final states characterized by a total angular momentum quantum number of j = 3/2, whereas L 3 edge probes states with j = 3/2 and j = 5/2. Spin-orbit coupling effects cause a splitting of the final d states. This shifts the d 5/2 states to a higher energy with a corresponding shift of the d 3/2 states to lower energies. As a result, the unoccupied d states above the Fermi level are predominantly those with j = 5/2. This accounts for the enhanced peak at the L 3 edge for Pt that corresponds to ejection of an electron from a 2p 3/2 core state. This feature is referred to as a "white line" as it showed up as such in the days when photographic plate was used as the detector.

Electrochemical Cell:
The cell used for the in situ electrochemical measurements presented in later sections is a modified version of the one described by McBreen et al.6 Data Analysis of XAS Spectra

Interpretation of XANES:
Even though no simple equation exists for the XANES region, the XANES spectrum can always be modeled qualitatively and in certain instances also quantitatively by LCA or PCA analysis. The edge shift toward higher or lower energies is the consequence of the oxidation state of the photoabsorber and can be modeled as well. Furthermore, XANES spectrum often shows unique "pre-edge" features that are easily identified and can be used in fingerprinting.In the fingerprinting technique, the obtained spectrum is visually compared to the spectra of the same element in various oxidation states and environments, to see if they match. The technique gives the proper answer only if the sample has predominantly the same composition as one of the standards. At the K-edges of the first row transition elements, the transition is mostly from 1s to 4p states. However, small preedge peaks due to the weaker quadrupole (Δl = AE2) are often observed in cases where there is an inversion of symmetry (e.g., the rock-salt structure). These correspond to 1s to 3d transitions that become allowed due to, the p-d hybridization. For instance, in the case of chromium compounds, the tetrahedral Cr 6+ ion shows an extremely large pre-edge peak, whereas it is much smaller in octahedral Cr 3+If the sample is a mixture of two or more components, one can carry on the LCA technique in an attempt to make a match of the spectrum of the sample by adding together fractions of the spectra of various standards. As a computer technique, the routine is easy and works well as long as the standards for all constituents are given. An example of XANES interpretation, Δμ analysis, and LCA technique will be shown in Sect. 7.1.If one has a limited knowledge of the sample but plenty of related spectra, as in a series of samples with various compositions or a single sample under different conditions, the PCA computer routine can be used to identify the set of components that account for the spectra in decreasing order of importance. The technique provides information whether individual constituents are present and how many of them are in the sample. It is most often used when the spectra are taken "in operando" while conditions like temperature, pressure, voltage, or concentration cause the change in the XANES spectra.

EXAFS Spectrum Processing:
Processing of an EXAFS spectrum is based on fitting the spectrum to a predicted structure. While there are several computer programs for this purpose, the one used in the interpretation of the examples given later in this chapter is based on the Demeter package. The freeware includes Athena program containing LCA and PCA routines for XANES analysis, as well as data reduction and extraction of the sinusoidal EXAFS wave, Artemis program for fitting the EXAFS spectrum to a certain structure predicted on a reasonable assumption or other information about the sample, an automated program for ab initio multiple-scattering calculations for clusters of atoms (FEFF), as well as a number of helpful programs for data acquisition and processing

Fitting of Bulk Materials:
Data reduction is done in Athena program, by subtracting the spectrum of an isolated atom μ 0 (E) from the real spectrum μ(E) and normalizing the obtained sinusoidal wave to 1 as in Eq. 6.3. The χ(E) spectrum is then converted to χ(k) by the Eq. 6.4 and plotted against the photoelectron momentum k as in Fig.Peak fitting is based on matching the experimentally obtained spectrum to the theoretical one, based on the predicted structure. The structure can be either inputted directly using Atoms routine in the Artemis program or using Atoms input archive available on the Web

Fitting of Monometallic Nanoparticles:
Metallic nanoparticles have unique physical and chemical properties attractive for use in various research areas, in particular as the active component in supported metal catalysis

Fitting of Bimetallic Nanoparticles:
For metal-metal nanoparticles, it was shown that the coordination numbers and distances between metals can reveal its internal structurewhere N(M 1 M 2 ) is the coordination number between the metals M 1 and M 2 , x(M 1 ) and x(M 2 ) are the mole fractions of the metal M 1 and M 2 , and R(M i M j ) is the interatomic distance between atoms i and j. Heterogeneous mixtures consisting of two segregated metals can form either a core-shell nanoparticle, in which one metal is preferentially found in the core of the nanoparticle and the other forms a shell around it, or an aggregate mixture, where each metal makes its own nanoparticle with minimal, if any, mixing with the other.In core-shell nanoparticle, an atom of the core metal (M core ) is surrounded mostly with atoms of the same type, whereas the M shell atom feels the presence of both the atoms of the same type that form the shell, as well as that of the other type of atoms forming the core; however, atoms in the shell always have lower coordination number. In addition, for a core-shell nanoparticle of a certain size, the total coordination number of the core atoms should be similar to the average coordination number for the nanoparticle of the same size composed of core atoms only, N(M core_nanoparticle ). Finally, the distance between two atoms in the core should be similar to their bulk interatomic distance R (M core_bulk ), while the distance between two atoms in the shell can be either smaller or larger than bulk interatomic distance R shell_bulk , depending on the relative sizes of the two metals comprising the core-shell particle. Thus, the following equations apply:Aggregate mixtures consist of two nanoparticles completely separated from one another, each consisting of one type of metal atoms only. Hence, the following relations describe it:where R (M 1_bulk ) represents the distance of two atoms of metal 1 in the bulk.Fitting of a bimetallic nanoparticle can be done relatively easily using Artemis. In the example below, the procedure for simultaneous fitting of the alloy of two fcc metals (Pt and Rh) is described. To reduce the number of fitted parameters and thus obtain a more reliable fit, supporting information on the size and the mole fraction of Pt and Rh in the particle were obtained by independent techniques, TEM, and inductively coupled plasma (ICP).One starts by inputting the Rh K-edge EXAFS sinusoidal wave (derived by Athena) into Artemis. In Atoms routine, one inputs the space group and the crystal structure parameters. Assuming that the Pt-Rh distance would be the average between Pt-Pt and Rh-Rh bond distances, which are R(Pt-Pt) = 277.5 pm and R (Rh-Rh) = 269.0 pm, respectively, the R(Pt-Rh) = 273.3 pm = 2.733 Å, and the lattice parameter of Pt-Rh is a¼2 1 = 2 R Pt-Rh = 3.865 Å. Filling the Atoms page with appropriate parameters shown in Fig.Since one atom was replaced with the different scatterer in FEFF input files only in the list of first nearest neighbors, the fit is only valid for the first coordination shell. Thus, only the first two scattering events (or paths) should be taken from the both FEFF scattering lists, i.e., one path in which the scatterer is the same atom type as the absorber and the other path with different absorber-scatterer pair.The generated FEFF files are the theoretical scattering events, and Artemis fits the experimentally obtained spectra to it. Since each scattering path contains four fitting parameters (ΔE 0 , ΔR, σ 2 , and NS 0 2 ), the first-shell fitting of a bimetallic particle has 16 parameters. However, the number of fitted parameters cannot be larger than the number of independent points, n ip :where Δk and ΔR are the windows in k-space and R-space. Assuming typical values for a first-shell fit (Δk % 12 and ΔR % 2), the number of independent points is n ip % 15. Fortunately, certain parameters can be fixed. First, assuming that the Pt and Rh form solid solution and their mole fractions are found by ICP, the coordination number of one of the metals can be expressed in terms of the other one by Eq. 6.6a, so that only one coordination number is fitted. Second, both the change in the distance ΔR and the Debye-Waller factor σ 2 affecting the Pt-Rh scattering path are the same irrespective of the absorbing atom, so ΔR(Pt-Rh) = ΔR(Rh-Pt) and σ 2 (Pt-Rh) = σ 2 (Rh-Pt). And third, the ΔE 0 must be the same for both paths in one FEFF. Taking all these assumptions into the account, the number of fitted parameters reduces to 11. In addition, by fitting two edges concurrently, n ip becomes substantially larger than the number of fitted parameters, producing a reliable fit.It should be noted that Artemis fits the product of the coordination number and the amplitude reduction factor, NS 0 2 . To find the coordination number N, one determines the amplitude reduction factor S 0 2 for both Pt and Rh by fitting the spectrum of the pure metal (metal foil), and use them in all subsequent fittings for that metal.

Selected Examples:
Although the XAS technique is routinely used in a number of different scientific disciplines, in the examples shown below, only those of interest to electrocatalysis are illustrated. However, the similar XAS processing procedures can be applied to other areas of science, especially in those where nanomaterials are used. We start by explaining how to obtain relevant information from subtle changes in XANES spectra, as well as the procedure to quantitatively derive the number of atoms in a nanoparticle shell that become oxidized during an electrochemical reaction. Selected examples on EXAFS processing data obtained during electrochemical reactions on both anode and cathode catalysts are given further, together with the correlation of XAS results to that obtained by other spectroscopy techniques.

In Situ XANES for Pt Oxidation of Carbon-Supported Pt NanoparticlesPlatinum undoubtedly is the best catalyst for both the anode and cathode. However, its catalytic activity degrades easily with oxidation of the surface. It is also known that the gradual decline in performance of low-temperature fuel cells is caused by the dissolution of carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles at the cathode during potential cycling, resulting in the loss of the electrochemical surface area. A detailed understanding of oxidation/dissolution mechanisms of Pt is therefore critical in designing durable catalysts. FigureWe should note that the electrochemical cell (Fig.The delta mu (Δμ) technique has been developed as a surface-sensitive method to identify surface/adsorbate interactions

Application of EXAFS in Fuel Cells:
Schematic diagram of a fuel cell in acidic medium is presented in Fig.

Ethanol Oxidation on Pt and Pt-M Bimetallic Anodes:
Ethanol is considered as an ideal combustible for fuel cells because of its high energy-density, likely production from renewable sources, as well as ease of storage and transportationThe total oxidation of ethanol (n = 2) delivers 12 electrons and 12 protons. However, as shown in Fig.Pt surface is an exceptional catalyst in the sense that it adsorbs most species in an electrochemical solution. Carbon-containing species like CO ads are especially strongly adsorbed; thus, blocking Pt sites for further adsorption of reactants. CO ads can only be removed by oxidation which occurs at high electrode potentials. When the Pt surface becomes covered by Pt-OH or Pt-O species by oxidation of water, they react with CO ads yielding CO 2 as the final product. The water oxidation occurs at potentials higher than 0.6 V which are impractical for fuel cell uses. Thus, Pt is an inadequate electrocatalyst for DEFC, and efforts to improve its activity have been concentrated on the addition of co-catalysts that supply oxygen-containing species at lower potentials and donate them to Pt for the oxidative removal of CO-like species. Of binary alloys, Pt-Sn and Pt-SnO 2 show the best oxidation rates that are about three times higher than on Pt, as Sn or SnO 2 supply OH groups from water. Nevertheless, the oxidation of ethanol is still incomplete as products with C-C bond intact are formed

Pt/Rh/SnO 2 Ternary Catalyst for Ethanol Oxidation:
Rhodium has been used for decades in three-way catalytic converters in vehicles for its catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides. Recently, metal/gas interface studies revealed that Rh is active in splitting C-C bondElectrochemical measurements of ethanol oxidation demonstrated a considerably higher EOR activity of the ternary Pt-Rh-SnO 2 catalyst with respect to that of the binary Pt-SnO 2 catalyst, highlighting the importance of the Rh componentEXAFS studies were conducted in operando to reveal the internal structure of the catalyst. Sn K-edge spectrum (Fig.

EXAFS Fitting of Pt-Rh-SnO 2 Nanocatalyst:
EXAFS studies were conducted to reveal the internal structure of Pt/Rh nanoclusters. The FEFF paths were constructed as described in Sect. 6.2. The results of the fit are shown in Fig.Coordination numbers N(Rh-Pt) and N(Pt-Rh) revealed the average composition of the nanoparticles,The obtained Pt-metal and Rh-metal coordination numbers wereTheir close values are consistent with homogeneous distribution of Pt and Rh throughout the particles (see Eq. 6.6b). Also, as the N(Pt-Pt)/N(Pt-Rh) and N (Rh-Pt)/N(Rh-Rh) ratios were found to be consistent within the uncertainties, with the bulk ratios of Pt and Rh concentrations obtained independently by EXAFS and ICP, we conclude that the Pt and Rh formed a quasi-random alloy. This is also supported by the similarity between the Pt-Pt, Pt-Rh, and Rh-Rh bond lengths found by the EXAFS analysis: 2.743 AE 0.003, 2.725 AE 0.004, and 2.705 AE 0.005 Å, respectively, that is, characterized by a much smaller spread than between pure Pt (2.775 Å) and Rh (2.689 Å). Finally, the average of total coordination numbers for Pt-metal and Rh-metal (10.0 AE 0.8) suggests that the size of the nanoparticles is within 1.5 and 3.5 nm, which is in good agreement with the range found by TEM (1-3 nm)

Optimizing Pt-Rh-SnO 2 Nanocatalyst:
Further improvement of the catalytic properties of the ternary catalyst was done by optimizing the molar fractions of the three constituents in Pt/Rh/SnO 2 . The composition and the particle size were controlled by simultaneous codeposition onto carbon support of all three metals by reduction of their soluble chlorides by ethylene glycol and oxidizing Sn to SnO 2 by heating in air. This technique produces PtRh particles of an average size of 1.5 nm with a narrow distributionThe catalyst with Pt:Rh = 1: 1 = 3 also shows the best selectivity toward the total oxidation pathway in the EOR of ethanol, as shown in Fig.Electrochemical measurements were conducted on two catalysts with stoichiometric atomic ratio of Pt 21 Rh 5 Sn 39 and Pt 23 Rh 5 Sn 26 (both adsorbed on carbon), and their activity compared to the commercially available Pt/C and PtRu/C. The results show that the oxidation currents of the ternary catalysts, normalized to the noble metal loading, are considerably greater than that of the commercial ones and show lower oxidation onset. Between the two ternary catalysts, the one with the lower Sn loading shows better activity, lower onset of ethanol oxidation, and greater stability in chronoamperometric tests. As the two catalysts have roughly the same Pt:Rh ratio, the difference is ascribed to change in the SnO 2 content. FigureThe changes in the white line of both Pt and Rh may be correlated to the metal-SnO 2 spillover process in the ternary system that affects the oxidation of the noble metals. While the SnO 2 shifts the oxidation of noble metals to positive potentials, it appears that a too high content of SnO 2 at the catalysts surface lowers its activity for oxidation of alcohols. At potentials higher than 0.41 V, Pt sites in PtRh nanoclusters form bonds with OH provided by the SnO 2 and become unavailable for adsorption of ethanol. Similarly, too high content of SnO 2 in the ternary catalyst affects the Rh oxidation, which is evident at Rh XANES spectra obtained during the potential excursion from 0.06 to 0.91 V that show isosbestic points, a prima facie evidence of the existence of Rh species in two different chemical forms while their total concentration stays the same. The Rh changes its oxidation state directly from Rh 0 to Rh n+ (where n is most likely 3), without passing through reaction intermediates having lower oxidation stateSecondary refinement of the ternary catalyst was carried out to discover the optimal ratio between Pt and Sn mole fractions. In these studies, the mole ratio of Pt and Rh was fixed to 1: 1 = 3 while that of Pt:Sn was varied from 1:0.67 to 1:2. The activity of the series of catalysts was followed by a number of techniques including cyclic voltammetry and in situ infrared electrochemistry, while their constitution was resolved by EXAFS. FigureThe first-shell fitting results of the Pt-Rh-SnO 2 /C (with Pt:Rh:Sn = 3:1:4 atomic ratio) electrocatalyst at a potential of 0.41 V are shown in Fig.

Substituting Rh with Ir:
Because almost 80 % of the world production of Rh is used in vehicles and its price is higher than that of Pt, further work was aimed to substitute the Rh metal with a cheaper and possibly more abundant metal so that the electrocatalyst can be used in mass production of portable fuel cells. Iridium is a likely candidate for replacement of Rh, as the two metals are in the same group of periodic system and have similar chemical characteristics. Although Ir is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust, its current price is less than a half of that for Pt and Rh.Electrochemical and in situ IR experiments performed on a series of Pt-M-SnO 2 catalysts adsorbed on carbon showed that Ir has the ability to split the C-C bond in ethanolXAS experiments were conducted to reveal the internal structure of the Pt-Ir-Sn catalyst. However, since the L 3 absorption edges of Pt and Ir are very close, Ir L 3 edge cannot be extended beyond Pt edge that lays ca. 400 eV higher in energy which is insufficient for EXAFS analysis, and Pt L 3 edge oscillations are difficult to separate from that of Ir L 3 . The XANES spectra revealed an oxidized state of Ir at all potentials. Both Ir and Pt spectra show a potential dependence so that their white lines increase at higher potentials, indicating their oxidation (Fig.

Oxygen Reduction Reaction on Cathodes:
The proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is widely considered as a high efficient and clean energy system. However, technical and economic barriers still exist in the development of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) cathodes

Pt ML /Pd/C:
The activity of Pt monolayer electrocatalysts for the ORR is strongly substrate metal dependent. The volcano-type plot is obtained from the activity of Pt monolayers on various substrates plotted as a function of calculated d-band center of Pt monolayer

Pt ML /PdAu/C:
We improved further the stability and activity of the Pt ML /Pd/C monolayer electrocatalyst by alloying Pd with a small amount of gold to obtain a Pd 9 Au 1 alloy coreThe results of first-shell fitting for the Pd 9 Au 1 nanoparticles at a potential of 0.41 V with similar constraints discussed above are summarized in TableFigurePd atoms may dissolve through imperfection sites (vacancies) in the Pt monolayers. The DFT calculation indicates that Au atoms segregate preferentially at defect sites in Pt monolayers

Pt Monolayer on IrNi:
Core-Shell Nanoparticle Catalysts (Pt ML /IrNi/C) Using non-noble metalnoble metal core-shell nanoparticles as supports facilitates a further reduction of the content of the noble metal in ORR electrocatalysts. In addition, by properly selecting the noble metal shell underneath the Pt monolayer, activity of the latter, can be heightened through electronic and/or geometric effects. This new approach represents a viable way of designing electrocatalysts with enhanced activity and stability and with very low precious metal loading. We have devised carbon-supported iridium-nickel core-shell structured nanoparticlesFourier transform EXAFS from the IrNi nanoparticles indicate that the highest peak in Ni from the IrNi nanoparticles is shifted to higher R values compared to that of the Ni foil, while the highest peak in Ir from the IrNi nanoparticles is displaced to a lower R than that from the Ir black. These data represent the expansion in the Ni bonds and the contraction in the Ir bonds as a consequence of the formation of IrNi solid solution alloy cores; the result is in line with those obtained from the XRD measurementsThe Ir L 3 and Ni K-edge data were fitted concurrently with similar constraints discussed above. FigureThe interpretation of the coordination numbers obtained is not straightforward since they are the ensemble average values from both the shells and cores, except for N(Ni-Ni) that is derived only from the cores. According to Eq. 6.6a, the ratio of the coordination number N(M 1 -M 1 )/N(M 1 -M 2 ) is equal to the mole fraction ratio x(M 1 )/ x(M 2 ) for an M 1 -M 2 binary solid solution alloy. As listed in TableWe used a suite of programs that model polyhedral nanoparticles with different diameters, different Ir shell thicknesses, and different molar ratios of IrNi cores to calculate the atomic coordination numbers for various core-shell structuresOn the basis of this result together with those from the XRD and the STEM-EELS measurements, we conclude that the nanoparticles comprise core-shell structure with Ir-rich top layers on the surfaces of IrNi solid solution alloy cores. We deposited Pt monolayers on the surfaces of IrNi core-shell nanoparticles by a galvanic replacement of Cu UPD adatoms

Conclusions and Future Perspective:
A brief overview of in situ XAS techniques to characterize the nanostructured catalysts was described in the chapter, followed by discussion of selected examples involving XANES analysis of Pt nanoparticles, and EXAFS investigations of catalysts consisting of Pt-Rh solid solution deposited on SnO 2 for the EOR, as well as Pt monolayer catalysts for the ORR. The information on atomic structures, oxidation/ electronic states, and adsorbate species of catalytic surface during the course of a reaction, obtained by XAS analysis, provides a direct insight of the activity-structure relationship, as well as the origins for the activity and stability. The in situ XAS is thus an indispensable tool for catalysis studies because the data it furnishes can enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of electrocatalytic reactions at surfaces and provide a rational approach to the design of new active and durable electrocatalysts. With new synchrotrons developing worldwide, the technique has the promise to be widespread in scientific community.In Situ SXS and XAFS Measurements of Electrochemical Interface 1

Overview:
In this chapter, we focus on structural studies at electrode/electrolyte solution interfaces by means of surface x-ray scattering (SXS) and x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements using synchrotron radiation (SR) light as an x-ray source. After describing the importance of these techniques for structural studies at the electrode/electrolyte interface as an introduction, we explain the fundamental principles and experimental methodologies of these techniques. Finally, we describe trends in the development of these techniques and review the latest topics.

Introduction:
Many important processes such as crystal and thin film growth, corrosion, electrode reactions, and biological processes take place at electrode/electrolyte interfaces. In order to precisely understand the reaction mechanisms of these processes and to apply them to modern nanotechnology, it is essential to clarify the geometric and electronic structures at these interfaces with atomic resolution, in situ and in real timeIn the following sections, we first explain the fundamental principles and experimental methodologies of SXS and XAFS. Then, we describe the developmental trends of these techniques and review the latest topics in these fields. Because SXS requires a sample with long-range order, such as a single crystal, structural studies of the fundamental surface science and electrochemistry of surface reactions have used single-crystal metal electrodes. These studies have focused on topics such as reconstruction/relaxation and surface oxide formation/ reduction, electrodeposition/dissolution reactions on the electrode surfaces, several electrode reactions including electrocatalytic reactions, and the adsorbed ion layer on the electrode surfaces and the electrical double layers formed on/above them. On the other hand, XAFS is applicable to various materials, even those without long-range order, such as polycrystal surfaces, nanoparticles, and metal complexes in both liquid and solid phases, and has been employed to investigate the latest topics in the structural studies of those materials in relation to industrial applications.

Experimental and Instrumental Methodology . Thus, we can find precise three-dimensional geometric structures at electrode/electrolyte interfaces from SXS data analysis. In this section, we explain the fundamental principles and experimental procedures of these two techniques.

Surface X-Ray Diffraction (SXRD) Measurements:
In the general x-ray diffraction (XRD) method for three-dimensional crystals, the incident angle of the x-rays is higher than the critical angle, where total reflection starts to take place, and then, the bulk structure of three-dimensional crystals can be determined by analyzing the diffraction peak positions. In SXRD measurements, on the other hand, the incident angle of the x-rays is less than 2-3 mrad, below the critical angle. Because, in this case, x-rays can penetrate only 1-10 nm into the sample and most of the x-rays are specularly reflected, two-dimensional surface structure information can be obtained. When a two-dimensionally ordered structure exists on the sample surface, a small part of the x-rays which penetrate into the sample surface are two-dimensionally diffracted by that ordered surface structure. Figurewhere λ is the x-ray wavelength. The important variable for SXRD is the scattering vector, Q, which is given byand has a magnitudewhere the scattering angle, 2θ, is the angle between k and k 0 . Q is divided into a lateral component, Q hor , and a vertical component, Q ver . ϕ is the azimuth of the sample surface, χ is the angle between the sample surface and Q, and α and β are the angles between the sample surface and k and k 0 , respectively. In the actual SXRD measurements, the intensity of diffracted x-rays is measured when Q hor is varied by changing the position of the detector (2θ) and/or by rotating the sample (changing ϕ) at a very small Q ver (β and/or χ). When Q hor becomes equal to one of the reciprocal lattice vectors of the laterally ordered structure of the sample surface, a diffraction peak is observed. The atomic row spacing, d, can be determined from the value of Q hor that corresponds to the peak. In addition to d, the orientation of the structure with d can be determined by rotating only the sample (changing ϕ) while keeping 2θ (constant Q hor , i.e., constant d ). Thus, the two-dimensional average atomic positions of the sample surface can be determined from the dependence of the intensity of diffracted x-rays on Q hor and ϕ.

Crystal Truncation Rod (CTR) Measurements:
Diffraction and scattering from the flat surface of a crystal can be expressed using the reciprocal lattice rod called a "crystal truncation rod." Consider the diffraction conditions when the unit cell is defined by the unit lattice vectors, a, b, and c, where vectors, a and b, are parallel to the surface and vector c is normal to the surface, as shown in Fig.x-ray diffraction takes place only in the direction satisfying Eq. (7.4), using the reciprocal lattice vectors, a Ã , b Ã , and c Ã , which can be calculated from a, b, and c. This diffraction corresponds to the peak position of SXRD as mentioned above. On the other hand, along the c Ã direction which is normal to the surface, because the surface (or interface) is present, the periodicity is broken, and the diffraction condition is eliminated in the vertical direction and then scattering always occurs.In other words, due to the presence of the surface, a diffraction intensity distribution is observed along the rods which extend vertically from the two-dimensionally ordered surface. This is called a reciprocal lattice rod and this phenomenon is referred as CTR scattering, because the scattering is caused by truncation of the surface. Using a set of H and K, which represent the two-dimensional plane, each rod is referred as an (H K) rod. Positions on each rod are represented using the continuous quantity, L (i.e., Q ver in Fig.where N a and N b are the number of unit cells in the a and b directions, respectively.

Electrochemical Cell for In Situ SXS Measurements:
FigureAfter that, the thickness of the electrolyte solution layer is decreased and the SXS measurements are carried out.As mentioned above, the electrode potential should be kept constant during the SXS measurements, which means that potential-dependent structure changes at the electrode/electrolyte interface cannot be measured using the general SXS configuration. Therefore, various ideas and improvements of the experimental configuration have been made. Zegenhagen et al.On the other hand, Tamura et al.

X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) 3.2.1 Fundamental Principles of XAFS X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) is a powerful technique to investigate the local geometric structures and electronic states of materials of interest with very high sensitivity and elemental specificity by using x-rays to excite electrons from a core level to an unoccupied electronic stateThe fundamental theory of XAFS had been established by Lytle, Sayers, and Stern in the early 1970s and is summarized in a review and references thereinXAFS is divided into two regions as shown in Fig.In the XANES region, electrons in a core level are excited to an unoccupied state. Since those unoccupied states are sensitive to the atomic arrangement and surrounding potential, the position of the absorption edge and the intensity of the peak just above the absorption edge, the so-called white line (WL), reflect the oxidation state and local coordination of the x-ray absorbing atom. Thus, the XANES spectra are used as fingerprints for the identification of the electronic structure, density of unoccupied states, and bonding geometry around the x-ray absorbing atom.In the energy region higher than the XANES region, electrons in a core level can be excited to the continuum and photoelectrons are then ejected. The photoelectrons act as a spherical wave source that can be backscattered by the atoms surrounding the x-ray absorbing atom and those photoelectron waves interfere with each other. This interference causes a change in the transition probability and induces an oscillatory structure in the EXAFS region. Since the backscattering factor depends on the kind of the surrounding atoms, the analysis of the EXAFS oscillations reveals the local structure, including neighboring atomic species, their coordination number, and bond length between the x-ray absorbing and surrounding atoms.To date, various methods have been developed to perform in situ XAFS analysis.

Transmission Mode:
The XAFS spectra are generally obtained in a transmission mode in which the intensity of x-rays before and after transmission through the sample is monitored to yield absorbance as a function of the incident x-ray energy, as is the case of absorption spectra in ultraviolet and visible-light regions. A typical experimental configuration for the transmission mode is illustrated in Fig.where μ is the absorption coefficient, t is the thickness of the sample, and I 0 and I are the intensities of the incident and transmitted x-rays, respectively. The transmission mode is applicable to thin solid films or solutions in thin-layer cells. The cells are similar in configuration to those used for UV/Vis spectroscopy. Whereas quartz is commonly used as a window in UV/Vis spectroscopy, polymer films such as polyimides (Kapton ® ) and polyesters (Mylar ® ), with a thickness of several micrometers, are used as windows in the XAFS measurements because of their transparency for x-rays. In addition to the use of thin film windows, the thickness of cells needs to be small to minimize absorption loss due to the windows and electrolyte solutions.The basic configuration of in situ electrochemical cells in the transmission mode was developed in the 1980s

Fluorescence Mode:
When a material is irradiated with x-rays, electrons in a core level are excited to the continuum and/or photoelectrons are ejected, leading to the formation of core level holes. When such holes are created in a core level by the absorption of x-rays, electrons in an outer orbital can relax to the core hole, leading to the emission of fluorescence x-rays. In the fluorescence mode, the intensity of the fluorescence x-rays, I F , is compared with that of the incident x-rays, I 0 , to obtain "quasiabsorbance" as a function of the incident x-ray energy, instead of the transmitted x-ray intensity, I, based on the assumption that I F is proportional to I. It should be noted that this assumption is valid for a thick dilute sample or a thin concentrated sample. If the sample does not meet this requirement, spectra can be distorted due to the self-absorption of fluorescence x-rays.A typical experimental configuration for the fluorescence mode is illustrated in Fig.Using the fluorescence mode for XAFS measurements is beneficial for the following reasons: (1) when the concentration of the material of interest is very low, (2) the thickness of the sample is too thin to detect the difference between I 0 and I, or (3) the sample is too thick for x-rays to transmit, i.e., the surface of bulk materials. For example, it can detect Pt complexes with a surface concentration of ca. 10 À10 mol cm À2 , incorporated within an organic molecular layer on a Si surface when the SSD is used in a total-reflection fluorescence configurationThe cells for in situ SXS measurements in the thin-layer configuration shown in the previous section can be also used for XAFS measurements in the fluorescence mode

Total-Reflection Fluorescence Mode:
Since the penetration depth of x-rays is much longer than that of other probes, such as the electrons used in XPS and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), XAFS is rather "surface insensitive." When the x-rays are passing through a boundary between two media, they change the direction in accordance with Snell's law. As the incident angle becomes larger, the x-rays are bent toward the boundary, and total internal reflection occurs at the critical angle. When the incident x-rays are totally reflected from the sample surface, the penetration depth into the sample is typically several tens of angstrom, and therefore, surface-sensitive measurements can be achieved by utilizing total reflection.Although the alignment required to yield total reflection needs special equipment and skills, total-reflection XAFS enables surface-sensitive in situ analysis and polarization-dependent measurements by utilizing polarized x-rays as an incident light source.The EXAFS oscillation has a polarization dependence. For the EXAFS oscillation at the K absorption edge, the effective coordination number, N Ã , can be expressed aswhere θ i is the angle between the ith bond and the polarization vector of the incident x-rays. Thus, the bond orientation can be determined by measuring EXAFS data with both p-polarization and s-polarization, that is, polarization-dependent totalreflection fluorescence (PTRF) XAFSFor the EXAFS oscillation at the L III, II absorption edges, the coordination number does not dramatically depend on the polarization. The effective coordination number, N Ã , can be expressed asThus, even if the polarization vector of the incident x-rays is perpendicular to the ith bond, the oscillation can be detected, although its amplitude is 1/3 of that in the parallel case.

Time-Resolved Measurements:
In the conventional step-scan XAFS technique, the energy of the monochromator is kept constant during each data acquisition and swept to the next acquisition point. Thus, it usually takes a long time, typically more than 10 min, to collect a whole spectrum. On the other hand, in the quick-XAFS (QXAFS) mode, a double-crystal monochromator is continuously swept over the energy range through the absorption edge during the data acquisition, so that time-resolved XAFS measurements can be performedUnlike the conventional XAFS and QXAFS techniques in which mechanical motion of the double-crystal monochromator is required to monochromatize the incident white x-rays, in the energy-dispersive XAFS (DXAFS) method, a polychromator, typically a bent crystal, is used to disperse the incident white x-rays and all the data in the energy range through the absorption edge is simultaneously collected by a position-sensitive multichannel detectorThe combination of XAFS and a multichannel detector also enables two-dimensional imaging of XAFS spectra

Trends of In Situ SXS:
SXS measurements utilizing diffraction phenomenon require that the substrate should have long-range order, i.e., a single-crystal substrate, and it also requires a highly brilliant x-ray source. Therefore, structural studies at electrode/electrolyte interfaces using in situ SXS were not started until the late 1980s, when Clavilier found a simple method to prepare single-crystal electrodesAfter these pioneering efforts, with the advent of the third-generation SR facilities as even more intense x-ray sources, the improvements in the electrochemical cells for in situ SXS measurements described in the above section and the development of SPM techniques, in situ SXS has significantly contributed to fundamental electrochemistry, such as electrode surface reactions, UPD layers formed on the electrode surfaces, and ion layers adsorbed on the electrode. However, the number of electrochemical systems which have been investigated are limited by the available beam time and there are still unresolved issues at present. In this section, the latest topics in structural studies on the surface reactions of single-crystal metal electrodes, such as reconstruction/relaxation and surface oxide formation/reduction, electrodeposition/ dissolution reactions including UPD processes on electrode surfaces, several electrode reactions including electrocatalytic reactions, and adsorbed ion layers on the electrode surfaces and electrical double layers formed on/above the electrode surfaces, summarized in Table

Dynamics of Reconstruction/Lifting Process at Au(100) by Coherent SXS:
As mentioned in Sect. 3.1.4, in order to increase the time resolution of in situ SXS, various improvements in in situ SXS measurements have been made, including an improved electrochemical cell. You et al. proposed a coherent surface x-ray scattering (CSXS) technique that allows in situ measurements of electrode surface dynamicsYou et al. employed this CSXS technique to study the dynamics of the phase transition between reconstruction and lifting at the Au(100) surface in 0.1 M HClO 4 electrolyte solution

Pt(111)/Ionomer Interface:
The polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell, which is abbreviated here to PEMFC, is one of the most promising candidates for a new-generation energy conversion device because of its high theoretical efficiency for the conversion of chemical energy to electrical energyIn this respect, we constructed an MEA-like configuration of a PEMFC, i.e., a vacuum-evaporated Pt layer/PEM (Nafion ® membrane)/PFSI (adhesion Nafion ® layer)/Pt(111) system, as shown in Fig.

Au(111)/Ionic Liquid Interface:
Since room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) have unique features, such as tunability and designability, RTILs have been considered as an alternate liquid to water and organic solventsTamura et al. investigated the potential-dependent surface structures of Au(111) electrodes in the hydrophobic ionic liquids, 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide ([BMP]TFSA) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide ([BMIM]TFSA), using in situ SXS

High-Index Surfaces of Metal Electrodes:
The catalytic activity and selectivity of electrochemical reactions strongly depend on the surface structures of the electrodesHoshi et al. reported the surface structures of the high-index planes of Pt with three atomic rows of terraces (Pt(331) = 3(

Electrodeposition/Dissolution on Electrode Surfaces:
Pt on AuEpitaxial growth of a well-defined metal layer has been achieved by vapor deposition, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) under UHV conditions. Compared to metal deposition by these techniques in UHV, however, electrochemical metal deposition is economical and easy because expensive equipment is not required in this process. The conditions for electrochemical deposition of an atomically flat, pseudomorphic Pt layer on a Au(111) electrode surface were established based on electrochemical and in situ RSXS studies on the potential dependence of Pt depositionPd on AuWhen Pd layers were electrodeposited on the Au

Adsorbed Ion and Double-Layer Structures on Electrode Surfaces:
Adsorption of Oxygen Species on PtAdsorbed Chloride Anion on CuThe specific adsorption of chloride on CuAdsorbed Cation and Anion (Electrical Double Layer) on Pt, Au, Ag, and Cu Strmcnik et al. indicated that hydrated cations that are not in direct contact with the electrode surface but are still located well within the electric double layer, which consists of the inner Helmholtz layer (IHL) and outer Helmholtz layer (OHL)Strmcnik et al. reported novel findings on the influence of non-covalent interactions at the electrochemical interfaceAn in situ SXS study on the Ag(100)/alkaline solution interface performed by Nakamura et al.Lucas et al. structurally studied the electrochemical double layer at the Ag(111)/ 0.1 M KOH electrolyte interface using in situ SXSThe structure of the electric double layer has also been studied in an acidic solution by in situ SXS. Keller et al. investigated the structuring impact of an anion-modified Cu electrode surface on the near-surface liquid electrolyteIn the acidic solution, the full 3D structure of a Cu(100)/10 mM HCl electrolyte interface, where adsorption of alkali metal ion is explicitly excluded, was also clarified and compared with the alkali metal data by the same authors as above using in situ SXS

Trends of In Situ XAFS:
Since in situ XAFS does not require long-range order, in contrast to in situ SXS, it is applicable not only to single-crystal electrodes but also to various materials such as nanoparticles, metal complexes, and biomolecules adsorbed on polycrystal electrode surfaces and, of course, polycrystal electrodes themselves. Thus, taking advantage of the XAFS method, there have been many structural studies on polycrystalline types of electrodes, especially metal and alloy nanoparticles, in recognition of their technological applications to electrocatalysts. Since XAFS is not inherently surface sensitive because of the relatively long penetration length of x-rays, various techniques were combined to selectively extract the information from the surfaces of interest. At the very early stage, most of the XAFS studies on surface analysis were performed using electron detection techniques which are surface sensitive but are not suitable for interfaces buried under liquid layers. Thus, various tailor-made in situ electrochemical cells suitable for each application have been developed as summarized in Sects. 3.2.2 and 3.2.3.Pioneering structural studies at electrode/electrolyte interfaces using in situ XAFS were reported in the late 1980s by several groupsSince one of the most attractive points of in situ measurements is detection and identification of intermediate species adsorbed on electrode surfaces, surfaceadsorbed layers became a primary object of study. Abrun ˜a et al. successfully detected the Pt-I bond at an iodine monolayer adsorbed on a Pt(111) singlecrystal surface in contact with an electrolyte solutionIn research on corrosion/inhibition, McBreen et al. measured potential cycle dependence of the structures of the surface Ni-OH species of the Ni oxide polycrystal electrode using the transmission mode, which was explained in Sect. 3.2.2. In addition, time-resolved DXAFS was readily adopted for this system after its development. They also utilized the DXAFS technique to monitor the continuous change of oxidation states and local coordination structures of the Ni oxideSince these pioneering studies were reported, many structural researches at the electrode/electrolyte interface involving species such as metal complexesStructural studies of Pt and Pt-based nanoparticles under potential control have been an important subject because these materials are the most active electrocatalysts for the cathode and anode reactions in PEMFCsOne of the most important requirements for positive electrodes in LIBs is a reversible lithiation/delithiation capability without drastic structural changes because it is a governing factor of the cycle characteristics of batteries. Nakai et al. conducted a series of in situ XAFS structural studies on various lithiumtransition metal complex oxides (Li metal oxides), which are the most widely used positive electrode materials in LIBs, after charge/discharge processes

Electrocatalysts for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells:
(PEMFCs) PEMFCs are one of the key energy conversion devices because of their very high theoretical efficiency and relatively low emissions, as mentioned in Sect. 4.1.2.While typical doublet peaks corresponding to Ce 4+ were observed at 5733 and 5740 eV for pure CeO 2 powder, confirming that the CeO 2 is the dominant species, an additional peak corresponding to Ce 3+ is observed at around 5729 eV in the spectrum of the Pt-CeO x /C catalyst, showing the formation of Ce 3+ species as a result of the incorporation of Pt.After the Pt-CeO x /C catalyst was immersed in a 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 solution for the pretreatment, the absorbance, μt, significantly decreased (inset of Fig.FigureThe ORR activity at the Pt surface is known to be higher than that at the Pt oxide surface. Hence, it can be concluded that the Pt-CeO x /C catalyst shows higher electrocatalytic activity for the ORR because the intrinsic catalytic activity of the Pt surface is exerted through the suppression of Pt oxide formation by CeO x . Potential-Dependent Structural Changes of Pt-Based Electrocatalysts for the ORR Because the fuel cell reactions take place at the electrocatalyst/electrolyte interfaces, understanding of various interfacial processes, which affect the reaction kinetics and stability of the electrodes, is a key to the improvement of cell performance and durability. Extensive research has been performed to understand the ORR mechanism and identify the major cause for degradation of the ORR activity, by various techniques including TEMIwasawa and his coworkers utilized DXAFS and QXAFS techniques for in situ time-resolved analysis of the structural changes of Pt-based electrocatalystsXANES and EXAFS of the electrocatalysts were typically recorded every 100 ms and 500 ms, respectively, together with the current response after the potential step, and the structural parameters such as the WL intensity and coordination numbers of Pt-O and Pt-Pt bonds were determined for each spectrum by curve fitting of the normalized XANES and Fourier-transformed EXAFS oscillations, respectively, to yield the time courses of these parametersIt should be noted, however, that since the estimated parameters were averages of the overall Pt species, the change of each parameter was attributed to numerous  situ dynamic measurements, new species which cannot be detected by conventional steady-state measurements were not observed at present.Iwasawa and his coworkers also utilized the QXAFS technique in combination with mappingThe combination of XAFS and spatially resolved techniques provided experimental support for early reports of phenomenon such as dissolution, migration, and  agglomeration of Pt during the durability test. In particular, the mapping XAFS found the segregation of Pt 2+ components coordinated with four oxygen species in a microcrack area of the MEAs.Oxide Formation Process at Pt-Based Electrocatalysts During the ORR Degradation of Pt catalysts has been extensively studied, and agglomeration due to the dissolution/redeposition of Pt catalysts at the ionomer/Pt interface is known to be the primary origin. It was proposed that the dissolution of Pt was affected by the potential, particle size of catalysts, and oxide formation. Thus, an understanding of the oxidation states and local structures of Pt catalysts at an atomic level is essential to design a long-lived catalyst. Although oxide formation at Pt electrode surfaces seems a very basic issue not only in fuel cell research but also for fundamental electrochemistry, it has been discussed for a long period of timeKongkanand et al. investigated the oxide formation processes at Pt in perchloric acid solution in the presence of molecular oxygen and found that place exchange occurs at a potential more negative than that in the absence of molecular oxygen

In Situ XAFS Characterization of Well-Defined Metal Layers:
Deposited on Foreign Metals Well-defined metal layers deposited on single-crystal electrode surfaces, such as a UPD metal monolayer, are one of the electrochemical interfaces most studied by various in situ techniques, including SXS. There are a few advantages of XAFS over SXS to investigate electrochemically deposited metal layers: (1) XAFS is applicable not only to single-crystal surfaces but also to nanoparticles, and (2) XAFS can selectively probe the oxidation state and local structure of the outermost layer by utilizing bulk penetrating hard x-rays if a well-defined metal monolayer can be formed on a foreign metal substrate. Currently, determination of the electronic structure and local geometry of those metal layers on single-crystal surfaces and nanoparticles is of great interest not only for fundamental science but also for their potential applications for electrocatalysts in PEMFCsVacuum-Deposited Metal Layers on Single-Crystal Surfaces Friebel and Nilsson et al. prepared a well-defined Pt monolayer on a RhFriebel and Nilsson et al. also carried out in situ HERFD XAS of the 3D Pt islands formed on Rh

Electrochemically Deposited Metal Layers on Single-Crystal Surfaces:
Since the original work of Abrun ˜a et al.Rayment et al. performed in situ XAFS characterization of a Cu UPD monolayer formed on a AuFriebel and Nilsson et al. investigated the interfacial structure of Cu mono-and multilayer deposited Au

Electrochemically Deposited Metal Layers on Nanoparticles:
Electrochemically deposited metal layers on nanoparticles have attracted much attention as more practical materials. Various core-shell-type nanoparticles have been synthesized to modulate the electronic structure of outermost layers and have been characterized by in situ XAFS analysis.Asakura et al. prepared Pt-shell Au-core electrocatalysts on carbon supports by depositing Pt on Au nanoparticles and found that the ORR activity of the Pt/Au core-shell electrocatalyst is higher than that of conventional carbon-supported Pt catalystsRussell et al. prepared Au-core Pt-shell nanoparticles by two methods based on the combination of thiol encapsulation and displacement of a Cu UPD layer with Pd:(1) a Cu UPD layer was first formed on Au nanoparticles prepared by a thiol encapsulation method and then displaced with Pd ions, and (2) a Cu UPD and its displacement with Pd were simultaneously performed in a one-pot method

In Situ XAFS Characterization of Materials for Rechargeable:
Batteries Rechargeable LIBs hold a prominent position as electrical energy storage devices in a sustainable energy scheme. Lithium-transition metal complex oxides (Li metal oxides) are the most widely used positive electrode materials. One of the most important requirements as positive electrodes for LIBs is a reversible lithiation/delithiation capability without drastic structural changes, which is a determining factor for long-term durability. To date, most research has focused on the improvement of battery performance by synthesizing new materials for positive electrodes. However, an understanding of the reaction mechanism, including undesirable side reactions, may provide new insights to design more reliable positive electrode materials. The usefulness of the in situ XAFS analysis for energy devices such as batteries and fuel cells had been recognized early

Phase Transition and Valence Change of Transition Metal in Positive:
Electrodes During Charging/Discharging Processes Many groups have used in situ XAFS, often in combination with XRD, to investigate the electronic and local structural conversion of transition metals in various Li metal oxides such as LiCoO 2LiCoO 2 has been the most widely used positive electrode material in LIBs since its development by Goodenough and his coworkersTime-resolved in situ XAFS techniques have been utilized to track the dynamic electronic and local structural changes of the LiFePO 4 during electrochemical lithium extraction and insertionAbrun ˜a et al. carried out in situ XAFS measurements of Mn 3 O 4 during insertion and extraction of Li to identify the structure of the Mn oxide species in each processKomaba and his coworkers have also extensively applied XAFS to a new class of electrode materials not only for rechargeable lithium batteries but also for sodium ion batteries, such as Nb 2 O 5

Other Applications:
The photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic HER, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the carbon dioxide reduction reaction on semiconductors have been extensively studied because of the interest in solar to chemical energy conversion.Most of the semiconductors with a suitable bandgap for solar energy conversion are corrosive in aqueous solutions and are not catalytically active for these complicated multi-electron transfer reactions. Although many groups have examined the modification of the semiconductor surfaces by catalytic layers with metals, metal oxides, and/or organic molecules, both the efficiency and durability are still very far from practical use. A critical requirement for its practical use is the development of highly efficient and durable catalysts from earth-abundant materials.Various interesting processes are involved in the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic multi-electron transfer reactions, such as light absorption, formation of electrons and holes, transfers of those carriers to the reaction sites, and multielectron transfer reactions. Hence, an understanding of the structural change and oxidation states of those materials during photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic processes is still very important from the viewpoint of fundamental science, and in situ XAFS measurements have been utilized to identify the local structure and oxidation states of reaction active sites.

Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reaction:
Recently, we have demonstrated that an efficient photoelectrochemical HER can be achieved at SiThe HER rate is significantly enhanced after the incorporation of Pt complexes within the molecular layer. Since the HER took place at a potential much more negative than the redox potential of most Pt complexes, e.g., +0.51 V vs. Ag/AgCl for PtCl 2À  4 , we concluded that the Pt complexes were reduced to form Pt metallic  nanoparticles and that Pt metallic nanoparticles are the actual catalyst for the HERIn the Pt-V 2+ -Si

Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation for Photocatalytic Water Splitting:
Modification of semiconductor surfaces by metal oxides is an effective approach to enhance the catalytic activity for multi-electron transfer reactions. Among the various metal oxides, Mn oxides, which are analogs of the water oxidation center of photosynthesis, CaMn 4 O x , bound to the Photosystem II (PSII), have attracted much attention, not only because of their high electrocatalytic activity for the water oxidation reaction, i.e., OER, but also because of the interest in a unique role of CaMn 4 O x in the water oxidation.A variety of Mn-based compounds were synthesized, but most of them tested in homogeneous solution did not catalyze the OER. Recently, Hocking and coworkers synthesized a tetranuclear manganese cluster embedded in a Nafion matrix, inspired by the CaMn4O4 cluster of PSII, and achieved efficient catalytic activity for the OERWhereas a reduced Mn 2+ state was formed by dissociation of the cluster upon photoirradiation, a disordered Mn 3+/4+ oxide phase was formed by reoxidation Fig.Yoshida and Kondoh et al. measured in situ XAFS at the Mn K absorption edge of the photodeposited MnOx layers on n-type SrTiO3 substrates in collaboration with our group and found that the absorption edge was gradually shifted to a higher energy during photoirradiation (Fig.One would expect, however, that the oxidation states of the MnO x need to be maintained because the photoexcited holes are consumed to oxidize water immediately after their injection into the MnO x if it serves as an active catalyst for the OER. In addition, since all the experiments were performed in the conventional step-scan mode under potentiostatic conditions, only relatively slow structural changes were detected at present, while photoinduced processes are generally much faster than the time constant. In order to clarify these points, time-resolved in situ measurements are desirable to track the dynamic photo-responses of the XANES spectra.Jaramillo and his coworkers synthesized a nanostructured Mn oxide film which serves as an electrocatalyst not only for the ORR but also for the OER

5:
Conclusions and Future PerspectiveThe application of surface x-ray scattering (SXS) and x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) techniques using synchrotron radiation (SR) to structural studies at electrode/electrolyte interfaces was described, from fundamental principles and experimental methodologies to reviews of recent topics. In order not only to fundamentally understand electrochemical reactions such as surface reaction of the electrodes, crystal growth, metal deposition/dissolution, and corrosion but also to apply accumulated electrochemical knowledge to the modern nanotechnology such as batteries, fuel cells, sensors, and molecular devices, we need to know the potential-dependent structures present at the electrode/electrolyte interface, with both high spatial and high time resolution. For this purpose, it is essential to combine these in situ SXS and in situ XAFS techniques with scanning probe microscopies (SPMs) and several optical spectroscopies, in addition to theoretical calculations. When the sensitivity and the resolution of these in situ in real-time structure analysis techniques based on the technological developments increase and combination with other methods proceeds, nanotechnology will be more advanced; for example, energy density and lifetime of the batteries will become higher and longer, respectively, and sensitivity and size of the sensors will become higher and smaller, respectively. Therefore, advances in these techniques lead to our future prosperity.Gas-Phase Near-Edge X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) Spectroscopy of Nanoparticles, Biopolymers, and Ionic Species 1

Definition of the Topic:
Near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy probes directly or indirectly the photoabsorption cross section of a system under study as a function of the photon energy around the core-shell ionization thresholds. When the photon energy matches the difference between the core level and an unoccupied valence level, the photoabsorption cross section increases. The core levels are associated with particular atoms within the system under the study; therefore, NEXAFS spectroscopy appears to be a very sensitive probe of physicochemical and structural properties of molecules and materials. It has been intensively applied to investigate gaseous, liquid, and solid species. In this chapter, we describe methods to perform gas-phase NEXAFS spectroscopy of large systems, such as nanoparticles, clusters, and biopolymers, as well as of ionic species. We also review recent research findings.

Overview:
The development of third-generation synchrotron radiation (SR) sources, providing extremely bright and energy-resolved X-ray beams, established NEXAFS spectroscopy as a powerful and widely used technique to investigate electronic and structural properties of both organic and inorganic samples of increasing complexity. Particularly, gas-phase NEXAFS studies allow for an investigation of well-defined targets prepared under desired conditions. Unfortunately, gas-phase NEXAFS spectroscopy of large species such as biopolymers (e.g., proteins and DNA) and nanoparticles, as well as ionic species, is experimentally very challenging due to great difficulties in both bringing large molecules or particles intact into the gas phase and providing high-enough target density, photon flux, and interaction time needed to distinguish K-shell excitation processes. Only recently, the development of new experimental techniques has allowed performing gas-phase NEXAFS of nanoparticles, biopolymers, and ionic species.Herein, we present the basic principles of NEXAFS spectroscopy and describe the state-of-the-art experimental approaches that allow for NEXAFS spectroscopy of large biopolymers and nanoparticles isolated in the gas phase. Finally, we present some key research finding spanning from relatively small biomolecules to large biopolymers and nanoparticles. Introduction NEXAFS spectroscopy has been used to study systems of increasing complexity, from small isolated molecules to large biological objects and materials; and it has been successfully applied to gaseous, liquid, thin-layer, nanoscopic, and solid targets. There is a substantial literature on the subject, from comprehensive graduate-level textbooks presenting both the fundamental principles and the applications of NEXAFS spectroscopy (e.g.,The strength of inner-shell spectroscopic techniques is based on the excitation of core-level electrons providing a highly localized nature of the triggering process and, thus, sensitive and selective probe of the electronic, chemical, and structural properties of the systemThere are tremendous amounts of results from gas-phase NEXAFS spectroscopy, which has been routinely performed on relatively small targets that can be easily brought into the gas phase. This incredible rise of the X-ray-based spectroscopy is dominantly due to the increasing number of new-generation bright SR sources. However, gas-phase X-ray spectroscopy of large targets has been reported only recently, after development of modern methods allowing for bringing such large species into the gas phase. For example, one way to obtain an intact protein in the gas phase and to submit it to X-rays is to use the electrospray ionization (ESI)The principles of SR sources are described in Sect. 4.1. The common spectroscopic techniques are presented and shortly described in Sect. 4.2. The sources of gas-phase targets are described in Sect. 4.3. Typical experimental setups for coupling the sources of large gas-phase targets with the synchrotron X-ray beam are the subject of Sect. 4. Finally, key research findings are reviewed in Sect. 5.

Synchrotron Radiation Facilities:
There are many different ways to produce X-ray photons, from laboratory X-ray tubes to the latest generation of synchrotron radiation storage rings and free-electron lasers. In this chapter, we will concentrate on accelerator-based sources. Synchrotron radiation (SR) is an electromagnetic radiation produced by the acceleration of charged particles of relativistic velocities. SR is intimately connected to a highenergy particle accelerator. Indeed, SR is the main mechanism of energy lost by the accelerated particles, due to photon emissions all along their trajectories. Ivanenko and Pommeranchuck in 19441. A wide wavelength coverage, from THz to hard X-rays. Moreover, with the advent of the third-generation installations (see below), SR radiation can be optimized over a given energy range (vacuum ultraviolet, soft X-rays, hard X-rays). 2. A high brilliance, due to the high collimation of the emitted radiation. 3. The time structure of the pulsed light.4. An adjustable polarization, from classic linear polarization with the electric vector parallel to the orbit plan (classic bend magnet radiation) to various polarizations including circular or elliptical (by using an insertion device such as an undulator; see below).FigureWith the forthcoming generation of storage rings, the ultimate storage ring light sourcesIn parallel with the development of synchrotron light sources, another type of installation based on the same technology is developing. Free-electron laser (FEL) sources use a linear accelerator followed by one or more undulators in series, in which the electron bunches are dumped after they emit their SR pulse. Initially used in the IR or in the VUV and EUV ranges, in the last decade, the X-ray FELs made available high-intensity femtosecond X-ray pulses of coherent SR to the user's community. The brilliance of FELs are orders of magnitudes higher than existing or future storage rings. As an example, the LCLS installation is capable of reaching an average brilliance of 10 22 photon/s 0.1 % bw mm 2 mrad 2 . These X-ray pulses are:These properties have made possible single-shot diffraction experiments of labile objects such as biomolecules or membrane proteins

Soft X-Ray Beamlines:
SR, after being emitted by an undulator or a bending magnet, is collected tangentially to the storage ring into a beamline, which comprises a set of optical and mechanical devices used to transport, select the photon energy, and focalize the monochromatic light to the desired area in the experimental chamber. The new-generation synchrotrons can host more than 20 beamlines, each one specializing in specific scientific fields. We will concentrate in this chapter only on the soft X-ray beamlines opened to users and that are specialized in dilute matter studies. Presently, there are 16 soft X-ray beamlines of this type around the world. With the later-generation beamlines, the synchrotron beam can be focused into a spot with dimensions of around a few hundred micrometers; even focusing to a few tens of micrometers can now be easily achieved. Also, the geometric dimensions of these synchrotron beams at the focal point are now matching the dimension of nanoparticle beams (few hundreds of micrometers) or even liquid microjet beams (tens of micrometers). Moreover, the brilliance on the sample can reach 10 13 photon/s mm 2 0.1 % bw mrad 2 . The resolving powers of the photon beam have also increased. Nowadays, a beamline designed for high resolution can reach a maximum resolving power of 100 000.

X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy:
NEXAFS spectroscopy is a commonly used technique in gas phase or surface science experimentsIn the case of relatively small gaseous molecules, X-ray absorption generally leads to an intensive fragmentation of the target. Therefore, the results represent partial-ion-yield curves of selected fragments, possessing rich spectroscopic structure below the ionization threshold corresponding to the excitation energies of the target molecule. Also, doubly charged fragment ions have increased yield above the ionization threshold. The application of X-ray absorption mass spectrometry has been limited until recently only to relatively small molecules, owing to difficulties to place in gas-phase large species such as neutral biomolecules (see the Introduction and the following section about sources of gas-phase targets).

X-Ray Photoemission Spectroscopy:
With NEXAFS spectroscopy, there is no analysis of the kinetic energy (E Kin ) of the electron detected. Indeed, the absorption cross section is a sum over all the electrons ejected belonging to shells with a binding energy (E BD ) lower than or equal to the photon energy (E Photon ). In photoemission experiments, the kinetic energy of the electron is analyzed. The relation between the kinetic energy (E Kin ) of the emitted electron and the binding energy (E BD ) is given by Eq. 8.1:Various kinds of spectrometers have been developed in order to analyze the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons

Coincident Measurements:
Compared to conventional electron spectroscopy, an electron-electron or electron-ion coincidence measurement is always much more powerful in providing a direct view of the interaction processes

X-Ray Action Spectroscopy of Trapped Ions:
Recently, the use of ion-trapping devices has attracted a growing interest, as it allows performing mass and charge-selected spectroscopyThe steps described in Fig.The ion spectroscopy experiments belong to the class of action spectroscopy, in which specific photophysical or photochemical reaction giving a detectable product ion is used to derive partial yields over the photon energy range of interest

Sources of Gas-Phase Targets and Their Coupling with X-Ray Beam

Neutral Molecules:
Relatively small molecules and biomolecules, existing as liquids or solids at room temperature and possessing low vapor pressure, are commonly vaporized into the gas phase and introduced into the vacuum conditions using ovens. The design of the oven must ensure, on the one hand, an increased vapor pressure needed to produce a satisfactory high intensity of the molecular beam, and on the other hand, it must prevent overheating and thermal decomposition of the molecules. In the case of crossed-beam experiments, the oven design also needs to ensure the formation of a geometrically well-defined target molecular beam. More details about the design of the ovens can be found in a number of previous publications and books (e.g., see

Nanoparticles and Large/Fragile Neutral Biomolecules and Clusters:
Laser Ablation One way to isolate nanoparticles or clusters is to produce them directly under the vacuum. For example, a pulsed laser may be focused on a rotating target sample comprising a rod or disk of the material under study, which is placed in front of a molecular beam nozzle where a carrier gas is expandingNanoparticles with a diameter of a few nanometers can be generated. The beam is then skimmed before entering the spectrometer chamber. However, to obtain sufficient energy per pulse, mostly nanosecond or picosecond low repetition rate lasers (from 10 to 1000 Hz) are used. The very unfavorable duty cycle (the SR is usually pulsed around few hundred of MHz) may account for small number of studies using this technique with SR

Aerosol Techniques:
There are different kinds of nanoparticle generators (atomizers, vibrating orifices, etc.), each one with their specificity and optimized for a certain type of nanoparticle. Some are able to disperse directly nanoparticle powders, while others produce liquid droplets containing nanoparticles, such as those developed to study aerosols. Usually, the nanoparticle sample is diluted in water or alcoholic solution. The solution is sprayed at the atmospheric pressure via an atomizer into small droplets, which contain the nanoparticles. The atomization is based on the Venturi effect, where a high-velocity gas (usually air with a pressure of 1-2 bar expanding through a diaphragm of few hundred microns) sucks the solution through a capillary placed orthogonally to the gas flow. The liquid is then transformed into small droplets under the action of the high-velocity jet. This generator is well suited to nanoparticles with a diameter of 10-2000 nm. Densities of particles from 10 6 up to 10 8 particles/cm 3 can be reached. It is the most commonly used method in synchrotron studies owing to its continuous mode of generation, but also because constant particle size distribution is generated. One drawback is the relatively high quantity of nanoparticles needed for an experiment. Indeed, concentrations around 1 g/L are usually required, which prevent from using of nanoparticles that cannot be produced in high quantity or those with a high cost. To remove the solvent, the aerosols pass through diffusion dryers, made of a stainless steel mesh tube surrounded by silica gels. After solvent removal, the dried nanoparticle beam is sent to the aerodynamic lens (see section "Aerosol Technique Used for Neutral Biomolecule Production", Fig.For smaller-sized nanoparticles, from 2 to 100 nm, an electrospray source (see section "Aerosol Technique Used for Neutral Biomolecule Production") followed by an ionizer (radioactive source or X-ray lamp) can be used. In this case the suspension of nanoparticles with a buffer is pushed through a capillary. The electric field applied to the capillary tip creates a Taylor cone producing small droplets. A sheath flow of CO 2 and air transports the droplets to a chamber, where their high number of charges created by electrospray ionization will be reduced by the ionizer source. The sheath flow participates also in the evaporation of the solvent. At the end, a very narrow size distribution of nanoparticles (almost monodispersed) can be reached, with a density of up to 10 7 particles/cm 3 . The liquid consumption compares favorably to that required for an atomizer source. However, this type of source has not been used often in a synchrotron facility. This is probably because only a 210 Po ionization source was available when those experiments started, which leads to difficulties due to nuclear safety regulations. This problem was recently solved by the possibility of using an X-ray lamp as an ionizer. However, as will be discussed in section "Aerosol Technique Used for Neutral Biomolecule Production", the difficulty of focusing under vacuum nanoparticles with a diameter smaller than 30 nm represents a major limitation in the use of the electrospray as a conventional nanoparticle source for soft X-ray synchrotron studies. Aerosol Technique Used for Neutral Biomolecule Production Kevin et al.

Coupling Nanoparticle Sources to X-Ray Beam:
The development, by McMurry and coworkersIn brief, an aerosol source (see Sect. 4.3.2) transfers into gas phase, from the atmospheric pressure, NPs mixed with a carrier gas (air, N 2 , He, Ar, etc.). After passing through a diffusion dryer, the aerosol obtained is directed by a split flow device into three different flows: one going to the aerodynamic lens system, one to a granulometry analyzer for characterization of the nanoparticles' concentration and size distribution, and one toward a gas exhaust line to equilibrate the gas flow. The gas-particle mixture enters the aerodynamic lens via the critical orifice (or chocked inlet orifice), a calibrated hole of around 200 μm, followed by a relaxation chamber. Its role is to fix the mass flow rate into the system and to reduce the ambient pressure to the operating pressure of the lens system. Focusing is accomplished by successive compression and expansion of a carrier gas through the series of coaxial orifices (thin plates) with different diameters (in the millimeter range). The NPs are progressively separated from the gas streamlines, due to the inertia principle, and focused along the lens symmetry axis. After exiting the accelerating nozzle of the lens into a differentially pumped chamber, the collimated nanoparticle beam passes through a skimmer to reach the interaction region inside the spectrometer chamber. The skimmer, in this case, does not skim the nanoparticle beam, but has a role of limitation of conductance to assure that the pressure in the spectrometer does not exceed 10 À5 mbar. The nanoparticle beam, focused with the aerodynamic lens, provides a continuously renewed sample. Charging effects, or degradation of the sample via interaction with energetic radiation, cannot happen in this case. FigureThe aerodynamic lens is able to focus nanoparticles into a beam of diameters < 500 μm (FWHM). The beam is also highly collimated (sometimes less than 1 mrad). Different types of aerodynamic lenses exist, which have been experimentallyEach set of orifices with different diameters will be able to focus different sizes of particles. Ideally, by stacking a sufficient number of orifices, an aerodynamic lens should be able to focus a wide range of nanoparticles. The lens geometries cited above are able to focus and have transmission efficiencies close to 100 % for particles with diameters above 30 nm. Below 30 nm, the Brownian motion of the nanoparticles starts to play a non-negligible role and tends to defocus the beam inside the lens, but also after the nozzle, which degrades the density and collimation of the created beam. Being able to create an intense beam of nanoparticles with a diameter below 10 nm is of crucial importance, since size and quantum effects start to be present only in particles close to nanometer size

Ionic Species:
Today, the variety of ion sources available is very important, with new developments appearing regularly and giving easier access to new classes of molecules. A typical ion source comprises a desorption/desolvation method to place the species of interest in the gas phase, and an ionization means to produce charged species. It is, however, possible to categorize ion sources into two main classes: atmospheric pressure ionization (API) sources and vacuum sources.Sources functioning under reduced pressure include electron impact ionization of vapor gas phase, as used by Thissen and coworkersAPI sources are newcomers in this field and are based on the generation of ions at atmospheric pressure prior to their introduction into the vacuum through an orifice or a capillary differentially pumped. These ion sources have been successfully used by Giuliani and coworkersOther API ion sources appear particularly interesting, although they have not been used for ion spectroscopy purposes. Atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) is a method giving access to very hydrophobic compoundsCoupling the Ion Sources with the X-Ray Beam The main difficulty encountered when performing mass-selected ion spectroscopy lies in the confinement of high-enough quantity of ion in a precise region of space where the interaction with the incident X-ray photon beam will take place. Photon sources of high brilliance are required for this kind of spectroscopy, such as delivered by SR sources and FELs. Three different kinds of experimental arrangements have been combined with SR and FELs to perform X-ray spectroscopy: crossed-beam, merged-beam, and ion-trapping setups.Historically, mass and charge-resolved action spectroscopy has been achieved using the so-called merged-beam technique. This method was developed by Peart and coworkers in the 1970s for the study of electron impact processes on atomic ionsPhotoelectron spectroscopy has appeared as a subsequent development of the merged-beam setup, with the pioneering work of Bizau and coworkers at Super ACO in the 1990s in the VUVIon traps are devices using a combination of electric and/or magnetic fields to confine charged species in vacuum. These devices, widely used in various fields of analytical mass spectrometry, have found applications in spectroscopyIon-trapping experiments complement advantageously the merged-beam techniques. First, these devices can be associated with a variety of ion sources, such as electron impact ionization in vapor phase, sputtering sources, laser desorption, or electrospray ionization. Second, ion traps compensate for a lower amount of ions in the interaction region by longer interaction times, which may be extended up to tens of seconds. Third, ion traps may be associated with other mass analyzers in hybrid instruments, such as with time of flight or as stand-alone spectrometers. Finally, the ability to repeat n-times the selection and activation steps opens up the possibility to do successive tandem mass spectrometry (MS n ).The first coupling of an ion trap with synchrotron radiation was originally reported in 1991 by Kravis and coworkersAlternatively, linear ion traps offer the advantage of higher detection dynamics and higher column density, as interaction lengths up to 265 mm have been achievedIn 2012 Milosavljevic et al.

Small Biomolecules:
Gas-phase NEXAFS spectroscopy of biologically relevant molecules has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. The general idea is that gas-phase experiments of relatively small molecules under very well-defined conditions can provide a fundamental understanding of the structure and physicochemical properties of certain compounds, as well as reliable data sets on their interactions with X-ray irradiation. The latter can serve as a benchmark for theoretical modeling and, hopefully, an extrapolation of the conclusions to real biological objects, thus allowing modeling their interaction with X-rays. As an introduction to gas-phase NEXAFS spectroscopy of large vital biopolymers such as DNA/RNA and proteins, discussed in more detail later on, this subsection reviews recent results on biomolecules representing building blocks of biopolymers. These relatively small molecules such as nucleobases and amino acids can be brought into the gas phase by using simple thermal vaporization techniques (Sect. 4.3.1) and studied by innershell spectroscopy. We also include a short paragraph (Sect. 5.1.2) reviewing recent results on partial-ion-yield spectroscopy of small organic molecules, which is out of scope of the present work. However, the experimental technique and the characteristic ion yields are relevant to the X-ray absorption tandem mass spectrometry of large biomolecules presented in Sect. 5.5.

Gas-Phase X-Ray Spectroscopy of DNA Components and Amino Acids:
Nucleic Acid Components A number of studies on X-ray interaction with isolated DNA and RNA nucleobases or with some of their derivatives have been reported so far, since a beam of free nucleobases in the gas phase can be routinely formed using ovens and submitted to tunable X-ray synchrotron radiation. A more detailed review on the recent progress in the application of synchrotron-based spectroscopic techniques such as NEXAFS, for the study of nucleic acids, can be found in Wu et al.Comprehensive gas-phase core-level studies on other isolated nucleobases, including cytosine, uracil, and guanine, as well as their derivatives, have also been performed recently. Feyer, Plekan, and coauthors have investigated tautomerism in cytosine, uracil, guanine, 4-hydroxypyrimidine, S-methyl-2-thiouracil, and 2-thiouracilFragmentation of DNA components following core ionization has been also investigated in the Kukk group using synchrotron radiation in combination with coincident detection of energy-resolved electrons and mass-resolved ions. They have investigated site-selective carbon core ionization of gas-phase pyrimidine derivatives

Amino Acids:
Gas-phase X-ray spectroscopy of amino acids has been attracting great deal of attention in recent years, since these biomolecules are still small enough to be brought into the gas phase relatively easily using classical temperature-controlled ovens, in contrast to their polymerspeptides and proteins. Recent studies include coincident X-ray spectroscopyNEXAFS spectroscopic studies of isolated gas-phase amino acids allow for an investigation of inherent properties of these compounds, without intermolecular interactions occurring in solid or solvated samples that inevitably influence their electronic structure and physicochemical characteristics. On the other hand, gas-phase NEXAFS spectroscopy of relatively short chains of amino acids (peptides) also allows for a controlled study of the intramolecular interactions in biopolymers defining their structure and properties. For example, Feyer et al.

Partial-Ion-Yield Spectroscopy of Small Biomolecules:
The absorption of a soft X-ray photon by a relatively small gaseous molecule produces a highly energetic core-excited state, which dominantly decays by a nonradiative Auger process leading to molecular ionization and intensive fragmentation due to the Coulomb repulsion

Clusters:
Gas-phase clusters are a logical bridge between isolated species in the gas phase and bulk materials. Inner-shell spectroscopy can provide deep insight into the electronic structure of clusters thanks to its chemical specificity. The technique has proven to be a very powerful tool for gas-phase spectroscopy and surface science, but its application to clusters, either free or immobilized, is recent. For clusters, it is well known that the bulk picture is at least partially inadequate. Indeed, in clusters a large part of the atoms belong to the surface, where the electronic structure is different from the rest of the material

Atomic Clusters:
Gas-phase optical spectroscopy of isolated clusters is not a trivial task. Measurement of photon beam attenuation through dilute sample represents a straightforward mean of accessing optical and magneto-optical properties of isolated cluster ions. Such measurements have been reported for Mn +In combination with an applied magnetic field, this powerful technique has allowed X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) spectroscopy to be performed on mass-selected clustersPhotoelectron spectroscopy of isolated and mass-selected metallic clusters has been recently reported using free-electron lasers, which allows compensating the low target density with increased photon fluxes within the pulse. In a pioneering study at FLASH in the VUV, the binding energy of 5d electrons of Pb cluster anions has been measured as a function of size

Molecular Clusters:
The fine structure of X-ray absorption spectra provides unique insights into the electronic structure of molecular systems; core electron binding energies are particularly sensitive to the local chemical environments (chemical shift). Efforts in X-ray action spectroscopy of ionic clusters have been focused on atomic clusters, and we are not aware of any studies of this kind for molecular clusters. Ryding et al.Daly and coworkers

Nanoparticles:
Nowadays, nanotechnologies are widespread in our daily lives. This has become possible because even though syntheses of nanoparticles are complex, they can still be transposed into mass production units. The final size and composition of nanoparticles can be well tailored by their production processes, whether colloidal or polymer chemistryAs discussed above, one of the main benefits of studying free nanoparticles is the avoidance of the influence of a substrate on their physical and chemical properties. An additional reason is the possibility of running in situ measurements of nanomaterials which can, for example, easily react with oxygen. A striking example is given by the recent study on pre-fullerenic nanoparticles by Ravagnan et al.The first study is on solid nanoparticles produced from a sprayed aqueous solution of sodium sulfate. When drying, the droplets give rise to Glauber's salts: Na 2 SO 4 .10H 2 O. This example highlights the ability of near-edge absorption spectroscopy in probing the local electronic structure of the absorbing atom. Indeed, if the near-edge spectra of the sodium sulfate taken at the S 2p-edge (see Fig.The second study focuses on functionalized gold nanoparticles with mono-or divalent thiol ligands and, more precisely, on how the ligands bind to the 47 nm +/À 10 nm gold nanoparticles. This work is in line with previous S 1s-edge NEXAFS and XPS studies that demonstrate that dihydrolipoic acid is bonding with both sulfur sites to gold nanoparticlesIn these two examples, the authors demonstrated the possibilities and the sensitivity of near-edge absorption spectroscopy when free nanoparticles are coupled with soft x-ray radiation. The element and the surface selectivity of the soft X-ray regime, coupled with near-edge absorption or photoemission studies, could play an important role in improving knowledge of the physical chemistry occurring at the surface of the nanoparticles. Even if the number of these studies to date remains still marginal, in the framework of nanomaterial studies, it should increase rapidly, as dedicated source and end stations are now available for users in several synchrotrons

Small Ions:
In their pioneer work, Kravis and coworkers have investigated photoionization of dication of argonThe first reports of monochromatic photoionization on atomic ions were produced in parallel by Lau and coworkers on transition metal at Bessy synchrotron

Biopolymer Ions:
NEXAFS spectroscopy of large isolated gaseous biopolymer ions such as peptides, proteins, and DNA has become possible only recently with development of ion trapbased experiments (see Sect. 4). The method consists of coupling an ion trap with brilliant third-generation soft X-ray synchrotron sources, allowing to reach both a sufficient target density and preservation of the ion packet for a sufficient time (for more details and an extended reference list on the coupling of an ion trap mass spectrometer with a synchrotron photon beam, see a recent review article by Giuliani et al.Ion traps allow performing tandem mass spectrometry at the nth level. Therefore, the NEXAFS spectroscopy of a particular precursor is actually performed as an action spectroscopy, by collecting tandem mass spectra as a function of the activation photon energy (see Sect. 4.2.4).The results represent a number of tandem mass spectra recorded as a function of the photon energy scanned over C, N, or O K-edge in small steps. The NEXAFS partial ion yields are finally obtained after normalization to the total ion current and the photon flux.Two experimental setups coupling ion traps with SR have been developed more or less at the same time (see

Peptides:
González-Magaña and coauthors have reported a pioneering study on the dissociation of the gas-phase protonated peptide leucine-enkephalin (Leu-Enk) [YGGFL + H] + ion upon soft X-ray absorption in the vicinity of the C K-edgeWe have recently studied NEXAMS of protonated substance P peptide (Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Gln-Phe-Phe-Gly-Leu-Met-NH 2 ), as well as its nanosolvation by a controlled amount of water molecules produced by nanospray ionization using a linear ion trap coupled with the PLEIADES beamline (Giuliani et al., to be published). Preliminary results suggest that yield of specific fragments can be strongly dependent on the location where photon energy is injected, i.e., on C, N, or O atoms. Moreover, upon nanosolvation, the 1s excitation of oxygen atoms related to water cluster seems to become very intensive process leading to abundant water evaporation. Gas-phase NEXAFS of such systems allows distinguishing characteristic resonances.

Proteins:
To our knowledge, the first near-K-edge X-ray spectroscopy of a protein isolated in the gas phase has been reported by Milosavljevic et al. in 2012FigureFigureThe fact that the resonant core 1s transition energies to frontier molecular orbitals of a large protein are not affected by its protonation appears to be even more interesting if we consider the ternary structure of the protein. Actually, the protonation can alter its structural arrangement if the protein is free to unfold, as a consequence of minimizing the potential energy of the system

Oligonucleotides:
González-Magaña et al.The relative photoabsorption cross sections, as well as the photofragmentation yields for protonated and nonprotonated nucleobases spanning over a wide photon energy range, clearly show an expected increased ion production in the vicinity of C and N core 1s ionization thresholds, as a consequence of the inner-shell core formation triggering the Auger processes. However, the energy step was too coarse for fine near K-edge spectroscopic structures to be studied. Still, the authors could compare the yields of protonated and nonprotonated nucleobases as a function of the photon energy. Interestingly, they found that the ratio between protonated and nonprotonated yields depends strongly on ion velocity and photon energy. For example, a significant increase of the yield of protonated bases relative to the nonprotonated fragments is measured at resonant 1s excitation of the molecule (see Fig.

Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons:
Gas-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been also investigated by means of near-edge X-ray absorption mass spectrometryThe experiments of Reitsma et al.It should be noted that the gas-phase NEXAFS spectroscopy of neutral PAH molecules has been reported, as well

Conclusions and Perspectives:
In recent years, the gap between NEXAFS spectroscopy studies of condensed and gas-phase matter has been shrinking. Indeed, the development of techniques allowing placement of intact species of increasing size and complexity in the gas phase has emerged, allowing study of polymers or nanoparticles. More recently, the advent of ion-trapping experiments has opened up a new area in the study of mass-selected targets.In this chapter, we have reviewed novel experimental methods allowing performance of gas-phase NEXAFS spectroscopy of large complex species. The chapter includes a short presentation of SR sources that can provide a high-brilliance X-ray photon beam. The inner-shell studies of diluted matter are extremely photon demanding, particularly in the case of large particles that can be collected in the gas phase with extremely low partial pressures. Therefore, development of new-generation X-ray SR sources was a necessary step needed to perform such studies. The chapter further includes descriptions of general techniques used to perform inner-shell studies, with a particular focus on X-ray action spectroscopy. Indeed, the more recent methods based on action spectroscopy offer significant improvements regarding both the sensitivity and selectivity of the technique in the case of low-density complex targets. We have also described novel techniques for sources of gas-phase targets, as well as experimental setups coupling the sources of large gas-phase targets with an X-ray beam. Finally, we review results spanning from relatively small metallic and organic molecular ions, over isolated DNA basis and amino acids representing building blocks of large biopolymers and finally including full proteins and molecular clusters.In the present chapter, we also review the results on gas-phase NEXAFS spectroscopy of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles play an important role in our everyday lives, and in order to obtain the maximum amount of useful information on one specific system, spectroscopic and imaging techniques are often used in parallel. It has been shown that under-vacuum beams of nanoparticle have the advantages of preserving the integrity of the targets, as well as cancelling any detrimental influence of the substrate on the physical properties of the nanosystem, but also the advantage of removing any aging problem as the sample is continuously renewed. Even if the density of nanoparticles remains low in the beam, near-edge absorption spectroscopy can be performed. Moreover, it offers a mean to probe functionalized free nanoparticles where a sub-monolayer of ligands is attached to the particle. It is important to note that another way to introduce nanoparticles under vacuum is to couple the spectrometers with a liquid microjet, in which a solution containing nanoparticles forms a jet under vacuum through a capillary. The liquid jet then intercepts the synchrotron beam inside the spectrometer chamber, following which the electrons created can be analyzedThe variety of samples that will be accessible to X-ray spectroscopy will undoubtedly increase in the forthcoming years. Indeed, analytical chemists have developed a wide range of ionization techniques, such as atmospheric pressure MALDI, and atmospheric pressure photoionization or ASAP probe, from which the atomic and molecular community can profit. The current tendency is to increase the control on the target. The benefit of mass and charge-selected spectroscopy has allowed to gradually bridge the gap between the isolated atomic ion up to the bulk through the study of continuously controlled cluster composition. For biomolecules, the effect of the charge state on the spectroscopic properties could be evidenced for the first time. However, control on the mass and charge may not be sufficient, and conformation-specific experiments could be necessary. It is very likely that in the near future, experiments will combine mass-selected targets using ion traps in combination with ion mobility to reach conformationally selected targets. Thus, further studies will allow for reaching unprecedented control of the target to gain deeper understanding of the physicochemical and structural properties of complex systems.

In Situ X-Ray Reciprocal Space Mapping for Characterization of Nanomaterials Introduction:
The tracking of temporal evolution of nanomaterials formation opens new possibilities to tailor their properties for the envisaged application. As a representative example, we quote formation of metallic nanoclusters on the substrates with different surface energies that are popular as nucleation templates for carbon nanotubes or dedicated substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The metal deposition time has to be precisely controlled to avoid cluster coalescence into larger domains. Here, the in situ GISAXS provides a precise monitoring of the metallic nanoparticle growth in real time. Another example is an in situ GISAXS monitoring of etching the nanoparticle surfactant shell by the UV/ozone processing. We can precisely identify the stop time for the surfactant etching in order to avoid oxidation and agglomeration of nanoparticles.The chapter is organized as follows. In the section Theoretical Background, we discuss the essential theoretical ansatz suitable for description of the measured GISAXS reciprocal space maps. In the section Experimental and Instrumental Methodology, we define basic GISAXS experimental geometry common to synchrotron beamlines. We highlight the latest advances in the laboratory GISAXS instrumentation. The section Key Research Finding is devoted to diverse in situ GISAXS experiments. We illustrate the usefulness of the in situ GISAXS technique for tracking the nanoparticles self-assembly at solid and liquid surfaces. A special attention will be paid to ex situ and in situ GISAXS analyses of multilayers. The coming trends in the GISAXS in situ experiments are compiled in Future Perspective. Conclusions summarize the presented topic.

Theoretical BackgroundThe analysis of elastically scattered X-rays is performed in the reciprocal space. The reciprocal space is defined by the transfer wave vector qare the wave vectors of the incoming and scattered X-ray waves, respectively (Fig.Generally, the amplitude F q ! of the scattered X-rays at the reciprocal point q ! is given by the Fourier transform of the electron density ρ rThe scattered intensity I q ! in the first Born approximation can be calculated as follows: This equation states that the measured intensity of the scattered X-rays in the reciprocal space is directly proportional to the Fourier transform of the electron density autocorrelation function ρ ~ð r ! Þ in real space. As in the following discussion, we focus on the in situ studies of the nanoparticle assemblies and growing interfaces, and we introduce simplifications of Eq. (9.2). In the case of particles or clusters, we deal with ensemble of similar scattering entities and their position correlations. For monodisperse systems it is reasonable to introduce a function P qalso called form-factor function, describing the distribution of scattered X-ray intensity in the reciprocal space by a single entity of ensemble, i.e., particle or cluster. In the case of ensemble with no particle correlations, known as dilute system, the final scattered intensity is simply given bywhere N is the total number of scattering entities in ensemble. In the case of polydisperse particle systems, a further generalization is required that is systematically handled in the literatureFor spherical particles we can simplify the observed scattered X-ray intensity to the form [1-3]where S(q) is the interference function given by the integral transformation of the pair-correlation function g(r) as followsFrom the experimental point of view, the pair-correlation function of particle assembly with a low size dispersion is easily accessible if the average particle form-factor is available. In many cases the average particle form-factor can be directly measured in dilute system using Eq. (Another system of interest for the in situ GISAXS studies are interfaces between two materials, e.g., in layered nanostructures. Using the in situ GISAXS, we can elucidate the interface formation, its modification, and diffusion processes occurring along and across the interface. The scattered X-ray intensity from a single isotropic rough interface can be obtained by rewriting the Eq. (Here, C(r) is the autocorrelation function of the interface height function z(r) which is directly accessible by surface scanning probe techniquesIn this case, the scattered X-ray intensity profile along q k is proportional to the power spectral density (PSD) of the interface roughness that is Fourier transform of the surface autocorrelation function C(r). A direct implication of Eq. (9.7) for the in situ GISAXS experiments is the possibility to track temporal evolution of the interface PSD in the low roughness limit. The absence of the q z component in Eq. (9.7) plays an important role in data interpretation near the Yoneda peak. Even though the existing multiple scattering channels add up with a different but constant phase shift along q k , the final intensity profile still can be related to the PSD of surface roughness. Moreover, utilizing a small grazing-incidence angle near to the critical angle, we can restrict the scattering volume to the subsurface region of few nanometers given by the penetration depth of the evanescent X-ray wave. This allows surface-sensitive in situ GISAXS observation of the roughness evolution during the interface growth or the etching process.In the case of multiple interfaces, the constructive interference of all partially scattered X-ray waves by local roughness has to be taken into account. Summing up all relevant scattering terms, one can derive the following formula for the total scattered X-ray intensityThe position of the j-th interface within the multilayer stack is given by z j . The Fresnel transmission coefficients for the incident wave to reach the j-th interface and for the scattered wave to reach the detector are given by T j i and T j f , respectively. The C jk (r) is the generalized cross-correlation function that correlates the roughness between the j-th and k-th interfaces

Instrumentation:
The small-angle X-ray scattering instrumentation can be divided into two major groups: synchrotron-based and laboratory instruments. The key difference is in the source of X-rays. The synchrotron insertion devices like wiggler and undulators produce the X-ray radiation with high brilliance and low divergenceThe laboratory SAXS/GISAXS system is composed of four main parts starting with an X-ray source (Fig.The second important part of each SAXS/GISAXS system is the collimator. The main role of collimator is to reduce the beam size and divergence. Moreover, it removes parasitic scattering surrounding the primary X-ray beam. The best angular resolution is achieved with the beam size matched to the point spread function of the X-ray detector and the beam divergence of the order of 0.1 mrad. These strict criteria are, however, in many cases sacrificed in order to preserve higher photon flux at the sample position. In general, the collimator unit is composed of two pinholes or motorized slits in an evacuated tube. The final divergence is given by the geometrical restraints set by the size of pinholes and their distanceAn alternative approach in the design of beam collimation system is the use of compressing X-ray diffractive opticsThe third basic part of each SAXS/GISAXS system is the evacuated experimental chamber. It usually accommodates a sample alignment positioner composed of linear and rotation stages. Recently, the hexapod positioning unit with six degrees of freedom has become popular for the sample alignment due to its compact dimensions compared to conventional sample positioners (Fig.The flight tube connects the experimental chamber and a two-dimensional (2D) X-ray detectorthe last basic part of the SAXS/GISAXS system. The length of the flight tube together with the beam size, beam divergence, and point spread function of the 2D detector defines the achievable resolution in the reciprocal space. In front of the 2D detector, two movable beamstops are locatedone for the primary beam and the other one for the specularly reflected beam in the case of GISAXS measurement. The beamstops protect the 2D detector against the damage coming from the high-intensity primary and reflected beams and allow prolonged exposure without overflow of A/D converters. Traditional 2D X-ray detectors for the SAXS/ GISAXS measurements are imaging plates, multiwire gas detectors, and scintillators coupled to CCD or CMOS camerasFor some applications of the SAXS/GISAXS technique, the nature of the sample requires a special design of the setup. The first example is the in situ GISAXS monitoring of the thin-film growth in a dual ion-beam sputtering chamber shown in Fig.Here, a micro-focusing X-ray source (Incoatec, 30 W IμS source) is attached to the frame of the deposition vacuum chamber and precisely aligned using a heavyduty hexapod positioner. The chamber is equipped with UHV compatible Be entry and exit windows for the X-rays. The anti-scatter pinhole is mounted on a three-axis vacuum manipulator placed directly in the vacuum chamber. The elliptical Montel optics with the focus located on the sample is utilized in order to maximize the scattered X-ray intensity. The angle of incidence and the sample position can be finely adjusted by the vacuum manipulator with three degrees of freedom. The scattered X-rays are recorded by a 2D PILATUS 200 K detector mounted directly on the vacuum flange. This system allows the monitoring of the thin-film growth on the time scale of a few seconds for taking one GISAXS pattern. The acquired GISAXS patterns provide information on the evolution of interface roughness, while the thickness information is monitored simultaneously by the in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry.Another custom-designed solution is the adaption of GISAXS measurement geometry to studies of nanomaterials confined to the air/water interface. In particular, the self-assembled mono-and multilayer arrays of metallic and metal-oxide nanoparticles at the air/water interface are attractive templates for many applicationsPrecise adjustment of the incidence angle is provided by robust translation and rotation stages holding a micro-focusing X-ray source (Incoatec, 30 W IμS source). The X-rays scattered from the air/water interfaces are passing inside an evacuated flight tube and are detected by a PILATUS 100 K detector. The GISAXS data are correlated with the other in situ techniques including spectroscopic reflectometry, surface tension measurement, and optical microscopy installed at a common workbench. The metallic, metal-oxide, and oxide nanoparticles have been studied intensively for many applicationsThe first example documents the self-assembly of colloidal iron oxide nanoparticles. These nanoparticles with low size dispersion less than 10 % are easily produced as colloidal solutions in large quantities by wet chemical synthesis methodsThe probing X-ray beam was aligned to hit sample surface at the grazingincidence angle of 0.1 and was subsequently translated upward in order to avoid the X-ray scattering from the sample surface. In this experimental configuration, we were able to distinguish between the nanoparticle self-assembly in the colloidal drop volume (Fig.The vertical scanning scheme is based on a fast and repeated acquisition of many GISAXS patterns during the vertical oscillation of the sample surface across the primary X-ray beam. Adjusting a suitable scanning speed and the detector acquisition time so as to avoid smearing effects, we were able to collect a large number of reciprocal space maps from different evaporation stages of the drying colloidal drop. During one oscillation loop, we were able to distinguish between three types of scattering from the drying drop that corresponded to three zones in real space labeled as Z0, Z1, and Z2 (Fig.A drying colloidal drop provides the self-assembled nanoparticle monolayer over a very limited area. Large and homogenous areas of self-assembled nanoparticles can be prepared as Langmuir films at the air/water interface. Using a modified Langmuir-Schaefer deposition, such self-assembled nanoparticle layers can be reliably transferred onto an arbitrary supportFigureIn the following we will describe in more detail the temporal evolution of the changes in reciprocal space during a continuous compression of the nanoparticle film at the air/water interface employing the high acquisition rate of modern PILATUS detectorsA repeated application of the Langmuir-Blodgett technique gives possibility to prepare nanoparticle multilayers with different kinds of vertical correlation between the successive monolayers as described above. In the case of vertical correlation, these ordered assemblies are nothing else than three-dimensional nanoparticle crystals in the language of crystallography. A simpler and faster method of their preparation is the solvent evaporation-driven growth from highly concentrated colloidal solutions. Here, we give example of the time-resolved GISAXS study of the kinetics of the threedimensional nanoparticle crystal growth from a colloidal solution of silver nanoparticles dropped onto silicon substrateThe post-processing of self-assembled nanoparticle templates by annealing, etching, or overcoating by another material is important for many applicationsThe etching of the nanoparticle surfactant shells reduces the lateral correlation length and hence the nanoparticle short-range order as indicated by a gradual decrease of the Bragg truncation rod intensity at q y ¼ 0:9 nm À1 . The analysis of The GISAXS patterns measured before and after exposure in UV/ozone reactorWe distinguish here the two GISAXS regions due to considerably different length scales addressed in real space. The first one, termed as GISAXS (Fig.

Time-Resolved Studies of Thin-Film Growth:
The nucleation and growth of thin films is of utmost importance for functionality of current electronic and photonic devices. The ability of the real-time GISAXS thinfilm growth monitoring opens new possibilities to tailor the final film parameters. For example, the in situ monitoring of the interface morphology of the GMR/TMR (giant and tunnel magnetoresistance) devicesThe growth of thin films is conventionally divided into the three representative groups based on the balance of surface energiesThe synchrotron-based in situ GISAXS monitoring of deposition process provides the highest-quality data with the millisecond time resolutionIn the first example, we present studies of the W layer growth by the ion-beam sputtering that was performed as a part of development of W/B 4 C multilayer X-ray mirrors with ultrashort period. Based on the balance between the temporal resolution and the GISAXS data quality, the 8 s integration time for one GISAXS pattern was used. Assuming the W deposition rate of 0.14 Å/s, the sub-monolayer sensitivity of the real-time deposition monitoring was achieved. FigureIn the following, we present the GISAXS measurements on periodic multilayers composed of two different materials. A simplified representation of the reciprocal space of a periodic multilayer is shown in Fig.The intensity and width of the Bragg sheets along the q z axis at the different q k values are given by the number of vertically correlated interfaces at particular PSD spatial frequency. Therefore, the cross-correlation function in a multilayer stack affects any lateral cut along q k in the reciprocal space, and straightforward extraction of PSD of a particular interface is impossible. Another limitation that precludes an unambiguous determination of the PSD function of a particular interface is the loss of the phase information in the GISAXS pattern. Using appropriate growth models we can, however, estimate an average PSD of interfaces in the multilayer stackAn example of the GISAXS pattern of Mo/Si multilayer with a series of periodically spaced Bragg sheets is shown in Fig.The in situ GISAXS measurement significantly simplifies the interface morphology characterization. During the growth of the multilayer stack, we can distinguish independently the contribution of each particular interface to the total scattered X-ray intensity. Moreover, adjusting the angle of incidence close or even below the critical reflection angle, we can significantly suppress the scattered X-rays originating from the already deposited layers. The observation at the critical exitThe last example concerns the in situ GISAXS studies of a periodic W/B 4 C multilayer growth in the dual ion-beam sputtering equipment shown in Fig.

Future PerspectivesIn the previous section we demonstrated that the modern X-ray sources with photon fluxes at the level of 10 8 photons/s can be employed for the in situ time-resolved GISAXS studies of sufficiently scattering samples, typically containing metal atoms. The latest advances in the development of high-flux laboratory sources including progress in the liquid-metal-jet X-ray generators opened new possibilities to perform the time-resolved in situ studies also on weakly scattering materials such as polymers.As an example we introduce a GISAXS/GIWAXS study of the annealing of the P3HT-PCBM (poly(3-hexylthiophene)) and (Resolution improvement of the laboratory SAXS/GISAXS equipments is another important development during recent years. Our studies using the channel-cut diffractive optics for the X-ray beam compression demonstrated possibility of ultracompact GISAXS setups with the resolution up to 500 nm in real space. The standard commercially available SAXS/GISAXS systems achieve maximum resolution of approximately 200 nm in real space. Using a linearly compositionally graded GeSi channel cut with the compression ratio of 21, we were able to produce the X-ray beam with the size 1.3 Â 0.2 mm 2 , divergence 0.5 Â 0.07 mrad, and intensity 1 Â 10 6 photons/sThe lower photon flux of the laboratory setup is responsible for the lower number of visible Bragg truncation rods in the GISAXS pattern when compared to the synchrotron measurement. On the other hand, the fitted width of the Bragg truncation rods is comparable to that from the synchrotron measurement. The high background of the laboratory GISAXS measurement results from air scattering as the setup was not evacuated. The synchrotron quality Montel optics coupled to the liquid-metal-jet X-ray sources (Fig.The highest brilliance laboratory X-ray sources based on the liquid metal jets are limited to few characteristic emission lines. In the following we outline a strategy toward a future laboratory high-brilliance, multiple-wavelength X-ray source capable of generating X-rays at common K lines of metals like Cu, Co, and Cr which are suitable for anomalous SAXS/GISAXS studies. These experiments have been widely employed at synchrotron beamlines by tuning the X-ray radiation close to the absorption edges of specific elements. The anode of the new laboratory X-ray source will be based on a liquid jet of colloidal metallic nanoparticles. A highly concentrated dispersion of colloidal nanoparticles is injected into a focused electron beam. If required, an infrared laser will be used to evaporate the nanoparticle-supporting solvent. Using different kinds of the nanoparticles, we can effectively tune the X-ray wavelength emission. Moreover, a mixture of two or more kinds of nanoparticles will generate the dual-or multi-wavelength X-ray emission. The point-like, micrometer-size X-ray source can be simply collimated or focused using two-dimensional hybrid Montel X-ray optics. The breaking nature of this nanoparticle X-ray source is the ability to emit continuously X-ray radiation at two or more characteristic energies at the same time. Such a laboratory source for the anomalous SAXS/GISAXS measurements is schematically shown in Fig.Large changes of the atomic scattering factor at the absorption edges of chemical elements are used to enhance the scattering signal from particular atoms and/or clusters and provide additional chemical sensitivity to the SAXS/GISAXS techniques. The energy-selective, two-dimensional solid-state detector will be used to measure simultaneously scattering patterns at two X-ray energies. A successful implementation of this nanoparticle-powered X-ray source will enable new physics, chemistry, and biology in laboratories and will rationalize exploitation of the synchrotron and free-electron laser beamtimes.

Conclusions:
In this chapter we have addressed various in situ time-resolved SAXS/GISAXS studies of nanomaterials including nanoparticles and thin films. At the beginning we reviewed a standard SAXS/GISAXS instrumentation and presented a wide range of setups suitable for the time-resolved studies in laboratories. The basic theory required to understand the reciprocal space data measured by GISAXS was presented. A significant part of the chapter was devoted to various examples of the in situ nanoparticle self-assembly studies. We demonstrated how the pair-correlation function of the nanoparticle assembly can be probed in situ during various processes affecting the nanoparticle ordering. A special emphasis was given to the analyses of the X-ray scattering from surfaces and buried interfaces. The experimental data of the time-resolved in situ GISAXS study of the multilayer growth were presented and discussed. Finally, we have shown how the last generation of laboratory high-flux X-ray generators can stimulate further development of the time-resolved in situ SAXS/GISAXS studies in laboratory conditions.1

Definition of the Topic:
We discuss here what important knowledge can be gained by X-ray diffraction (of course, more specifically, we talk of X-ray powder diffraction) experiments on nanoparticles and nanomaterials in general. Historically, the uses of X-ray diffraction have been to investigate (a) the crystal structure of materials at the atomic scale and (b) their microstructure, a broad term meaning deviations from perfect crystalline order on a scale that is larger than the atomic one but still microscopic. In fact, macroscopic properties of materials tend to depend on both of those. For nanomaterials, the focus is to understand how the small crystal domain extension and related phenomena influence properties that differoften in a very useful wayfrom the parent crystalline material. This means that the focus is on the microstructure, due to the fact that reduced domain extension is a (strong) deviation from crystal orderthis is by definition something that extends to infinity. Of course there exist crystalline phases that are stable only at the nanoscaleand in such case, the crystal structure determination still is very important. In this contribution, we shall review all modern experimental methods and especiallyas this is the core of the methodthe data analysis techniques currently used, from the oldest, based on the Bragg formalism to interpret crystal diffraction, to the newest, relying on atomicscale modeling.2 Overview

Nanoparticle Characterization:
The great discovery that for many materials a crystal size in the nanometer range strongly affects properties and opens large avenues to applications has spurred a concerted effort to understand why and how that happens, in the way that the resulting changes in properties can be understood and optimized for applications.If we think of the reduced size as an imperfection or a defect of the crystal structure (by definition, a perfect crystal extends to infinity), this is a case in which structural defects determine the material properties. To understand the importance of defects on tuning materials properties, the example of silicon is illuminating: all modern electronicsup to computers and handheld devicesare made possible by careful insertion of defects (doping) in otherwise perfect silicon crystals. Therefore, a complete and meaningful characterization of a nanoparticle (NP) must include its ideal atomic structurethat of an infinite crystal of which the NP represents a small portionand its defects, starting from the finite and rather small size, the shape, and other defects which may be induced by the small size (as surface distortion and reconstruction) or independent from it.

The Goal: Atomic Structure and Microstructure:
The most important analysis goal for NP is to determine the complete structure of a NP (or a system thereof), how that is affected by the synthesis method, and how that correlates with materials properties. With complete structure here we mean both the atomic structure of the "parent" crystal (crystal structure), of which the NPs represent small portions, and the microstructure, including all the defects -first of all, size and shapethat differentiate NPs from the parent perfect crystal. While crystal structure is of course an average property, and therefore it is the same for all individual NPs contained in a macroscopic sample, microstructure is stochastic in nature. A defect with a small probability will be present in some NPs and absent in many more. Surface amorphization will lead to as many differently structured NPs as there are in the sample, even if all the rest is identical. Size and shape themselves in most cases are statistically distributed in a synthesized NP batch, so much that in many cases synthesis progress is measured with respect to the narrowness of the resulting size/shape distribution. Therefore, while the detailed global atomic structure of a single NP is very informative, it automatically excludes the most important informationthat about the statistical distribution of defects. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) measures, instead, the averaged diffraction signal from a huge (macroscopic) ensemble of NPs; therefore, it contains information about the statistics of the NPs in the sample. While experimentally XRPD is an "easy" method, data analysis is a complex endeavor, especially when complex statistical microstructural information is desired. In the following, we will illustrate the state of the art in the experimental and data analysis methods for XRPD, showing the wealth of information that can be obtained therefrom.

Diffraction Versus Microscopy:
Nanomaterials are complex systems. This makes their physicochemical characterization a rather difficult task, the smaller the NPs, the complex the task. Therefore, extracting information about crystal structure, defects, size, shape, and composition is commonly performed through the combination of different characterization techniques, typically spanning from microscopy, diffraction, and spectroscopy. Among these, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), often used in high-resolution mode or in combination with electron diffraction, has been playing the role of leading technique, particularly for characterizing the distribution of NP size and their morphology. The successful impact of (HR)TEM in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology in the last decades, particularly when compared to that of X-ray diffraction techniques, is easily understandable after considering (i) the importance of directly visualizing unpredictable sizes and shapes of newly synthesized NPs (although just a 2D projection becomes available, unless an extremely timeconsuming tomographic 3D reconstruction is carried out) and (ii) the deficiency of conventional XRPD Bragg-based methods in characterizing very small NPs, which has typically limited their use to verifying the phase purity of new materials and, sometimes, to rough domains size estimation. However, since one of the goals of nanomaterials characterization is achieving the statistical distribution of defects, then investigating a larger sample volume using diffraction (or scattering) techniques should be considered a more appropriate approach, bringing the analysis to the most suitable statistical level. In this view, in fact, we have to consider the local nature of the microscopy probe, which typically involves a number of investigated NPs as small as 500, i.e., extremely shrunk if compared to the several thousands of NPs sampled by X-ray scattering techniques. An additional important advantage of X-ray diffraction versus microscopy refers to its sensitivity to atomic species, which makes the technique a valuable route to investigate sample stoichiometry and phase composition of complex mixtures of NPs or multiple nanosized components of different chemical composition. We will show, throughout this chapter, that diffraction is a powerful complementary tool to microscopy for nanomaterials characterization, particularly when the so-called total scattering methods are used.

Experimental and Instrumental Methodology:
3.1 X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD)

General Theory:
We will consider a parallel beam (plane wave) of monochromatic radiation, that is, with a single constant wavelength λ (if we think about a particle beam, as it is allowed by the De Broglie ambiguity, all particles travel parallel to each other and have the same speed and energy). When the beam interacts with something (an obstacle or target) placed in its path, some particles will deviate and perhaps exchange energy with the target. Here we will only consider the case when no energy exchange happens (elastic scattering)that is, the outgoing particles have the same energy as the incoming ones (or, identically, the same wavelength λ). Therefore, only the direction of motion of the scattered particles is affected. We define now the wave vector k of the incoming particles as the vector that has the same direction as the incoming beam and length k = |k| = 1/λ; similarly, the wave vector k 0 of a scattered particles has also length k 0 = |k 0 | = k = 1/λ, while its direction is now the one of the scattered particle. Define also q = k 0 À k as the scattering vector (see Fig.[Note: physicist prefer alternative definitions of the wave vectors and scattering vectors; these differ by a factor 2π, and as both definitions are broadly used, we will hereafter use capital symbols for the physicists' vectors, as Q = 2π q, K = 2π k, . . .]. We will also assume that there is no delay between collision and scattering; this means that the scattered wave starts with the same phase as the incoming one (coherent scattering). In the X-ray case, elastic scattering is always coherent, while with other widely used diffraction probes (neutrons), this may not be the case. If 2θ is the angle between k and k 0 , the length ofIn a diffraction experiment, we measure then the angular distribution of the scattered particles. The quantity we measure is the differential cross-section dσ/dΩ, defined as follows: if I 0 is the intensity (number of particles per unit area and per unit time) incident on the target, the number of particles detected per unit time in a small detector window covering a small solid-angle dΩ around any given (2θ,φ) direction is equal to I 0 Â dσ/dΩ(2θ,φ) Â dΩ (Fig.The measured dσ/dΩ at several directions contains information about the structure of the target. To see how precisely, we must go into the scattering process for waves.The incoming beam is represented by a plane wave, whose amplitude in any point r is given by I 0 1/2 exp(2πikr). The scattered wave from a point target located at r 1 is represented instead by a spherical wave, whose amplitude in any point R is given byHere b is the scattering length of the point scatterer; it is a measure of its scattering effectiveness. For large R and small r 1 , the spherical wavefronts become again approximately planar, so there we can approximate it as

Here we used the fact that, by definition, (RÀr 1 ) and k 0 are parallel. See Fig.Now suppose we capture this wave on a small surface dS, whose normal forms an angle ψ with the scattered wave direction. The signal per unit time measured on dS is then the square modulus of the wave amplitude times the area orthogonal to the wavefront dS cosψ. This yieldsand from the definition, the sum within the square modulus in the last term is just the elastic coherent scattering differential cross sectionBefore removing some approximations (like, that the atoms are point scatterers), we specialize the former equation to the case of an infinite perfect crystal. Then instead of a finite set of N atoms, we have an infinite repetition of a set of N atoms that represent the content of one unit cell, translated by all the vectors of an infinite lattice. A lattice vector L is an integer linear combination of three basis vectors a, b, c, L = l 1 a + l 2 b + l 3 c, where l 1 , l 2 , l 3 are any integer. The position vector of a generic atom is then L + r j andHere we have used Poisson's summation formula and -U is a constant (theoretically infinite) representing the total number of lattice nodes. -δ(x) is the "infinitely sharp peak" (Dirac's δ) function.-Η is a node of the reciprocal lattice. This is another lattice, with H = h 1 a* + Now we specialize a bit more into X-ray scattering. This affects only the scattering lengths b j . X-rays interact with electrons, and the elastic coherent scattering length of one electron is the classical (Thompson) electron radius r e = e 2 /(4πε 0 m e c 2 ) = 2.8179 Â 10 À15 m [SI units]. The scattering length of an atom with Z electrons would then be Z r e . This is true only at very small q, however; because the electron cloud of an atom is relatively not small compared to X-ray wavelengths, the atoms are not point scatterers for X-rays. However, to good approximation, the electron cloud is spherically isotropic, so we can simply substitute the fixed scattering lengths b with the X-ray atomic form factors f(q), one for each atomic species, depending only on the magnitude q of the scattering vector q and with f(0) = Z r e . [Hereafter we will adopt the usual crystallographic scattering length units, or electron units, in which r e = 1 so it can be omitted, and it will never be mentioned any more]. Similarly, to account for uncorrelated harmonic thermal motion, a factor T(q) for each atom (Debye-Waller factor) is sufficient. Finally, considering also that some atoms may be present with a probability o < 1, we have the corrected expressionf j q ð ÞT j q ð Þo j e À2πiqr j 2 (10:1)Last but not least, we specialize to X-ray powder diffraction. A powder is a very large ensemble of particles (crystals) with all possible spatial orientations and with a spherically uniform distribution of orientations. So we need to average the differential cross section over all possible orientations. This is done easily and it results to dσ dΩwhere d jk = | r j Àr k | is the interatomic distance between the jth and kth atom and sinc (x) = sin(x)/x is the sine cardinal function. This is the Debye scattering equation for a general set of atoms. If we start from the expression from an infinite crystal, we have instead dσ dΩHere averaging only affects the δÀfunction argument, where the lengths q and H replace the vectors q and H.Comparing the two forms of the XRPD scattering equation leads to some important conclusions. We need, however, to address also the effects brought about by crystal defects. Generally, crystal defects will lead to replace the δÀfunction with a broadened profile. This will be clarified better in Sect. 3.1. Moreover, additional scattering will appear also between the Bragg peaks (diffuse scattering). [Note that the distinction between Bragg and diffuse scattering is heuristic only, being there no way to differentiate them exactly]. The integrated intensities of the Bragg peaks, however, will not be affected by crystal defects, and they depend only on the (average) content of the unit cell. At variance, the Bragg peak shape and breadth will encode all information on crystal defects, crystal size, and shape. This has been the basis of classical Bragg analysis methodsboth for structure solution (finding out the positions of the atoms in the unit cell, their thermal vibration factors and site occupancies) and of defect analysis, as it will be recalled in the next sections. For small NPs, however, this distinction starts to lose meaning. Bragg peaks broaden enough that they are not separable and integrated intensity values have considerable errors. Moreover, the "diffuse scattering" increases and becomes very difficult to separate. Discarding it, moreover, would mean discarding an important part of information. Therefore, in recent years, the use of the full Debye scattering equationwithout the simplifications deriving from an assumption of periodicityhas been more and more frequently used, in spite of its complexity, as the sinc sum nominally contains a number of terms proportional to the square of the number of atoms in the whole NP. We will expand on this topic in Sect. 4.2.2.As a last remark, X-rays are scattered also inelastically and incoherently (i.e., actually, the vast majority of the X-ray scattering processes with matter). Of particular importance are processes where an X-ray photon is converted into another X-ray photon with lower energy. The main processes in this category are Compton scattering and fluorescence. Fluorescence lines are known for all elements, and with careful choices of incident energy and detector setup, they can be eliminatedat least at synchrotron sources. Compton scattering is quite weak and very close in energy to the incident radiation, so it cannot be eliminated with existing methods; however, it is fairly easy to calculate it and subtract it from the elastic scattering signal. Other forms of scattering do not cause spurious signals in an X-ray detector, but still they cause absorption of the primary and scattered beam while they travel through the sample, so special corrections have to be devised in order to obtain undistorted data.

Instrumentation: Laboratory and Synchrotron:
As most other experimental techniques based on the radiation-matter interaction, also XRPD requires a source of radiation, a sample holder (with its specific environment), and a radiation detector; the latter is meant to measure the diffracted intensity not directly down the impinging direction (as in most absorption-based spectroscopies), rather at different scattering angles (in the most common situations). Of course, beam conditioning (limitation of beam divergence, filtering or monochromatization, positioning of antiscatter slits avoiding spurious radiation, etc.) is also necessary and heavily depends on the overall diffraction geometry, equipment, and radiation source. Since there exist many different combinations of sources, optics, sample nature, size and shape, and detectors, the instrumentation part is here split into "independent" portions, which, after being assembled in suitable configurations, can give rise to a large variability of versatile equipment (the diffractometers). The interested reader can find more details on XRPD instrumentation in the nice book by Guinebretière

Sources:
The most common radiation source in the lab is the X-ray tube, which, operating at a typical power of 2 kW, can provide photon fluxes at the sample close to 10 8 ph/s. Commercially available anode materials are Ag, Mo, Cu, Co, Fe, and Cr, spanning, with their Kα characteristic lines, the 22.2-5.4 keV energy range (λ = 0.559-2.290 Å). Unless specific requirements are necessary (e.g., to avoid Fe/Ni/Co fluorescence effects or to reach high Q values, Q = 4πsinθ/λ, for pair distribution function studies; see below), nearly ubiquitous is the use of Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5416 Å for the unresolved α 1,2 doublet). This gives a good range of accessible d values, a limited overlap (for moderately complex materials), and reasonably treatable transparency/absorption effects. Boosted sources, allowing a max. tenfold increase of flux, at the expenses of a significantly higher cost and maintenance requirements, are rotating anodes. While originally developed for point focus experiments (small molecule or protein single-crystal diffractometry), they have also been recently adapted, and improved, for other kinds of instrumentation: as highly brilliant microfocus sources (down to diameters of 70 μm) for scanning SAXS and WAXS (small and wide-angle X-ray scattering) experiments or for providing line-focus beams for XRPD. In these cases, only Cu, Co, Cr, and Mo radiation sources are available on the market, with the interesting option of double-element anodes, providing two-wavelength beams.Definitely more appealing for the material scientist, and for the nanoworld, are X-rays generated at synchrotron sources, where extremely high brilliance, energy tunability, nearly null beam divergence, polarization, and "flashing" time structure can be independently, or simultaneously, exploited in devising specific advanced experiments. Fluxes at the sample close to 10 4 -10 6 higher than lab sources are normally achieved, making fast data collections on nanomaterials possible. For a high-quality pattern from poorly scattering nanomaterials, with the best detectors (see below), acquisition times of minutes are normal; when fast transformations are to be qualitatively observed, acquisition times down to 1 ms are currently possible. The wavelength (or the energy) of modern synchrotron sources is continuously tunable in a given range (5-38 keV for the X04SA-MS beamline at SLSDetectors Disregarding the physical nature of the X-ray detection event and its conversion into a machine-readable electrical current, several different kinds of detectors are normally used:(i) Point detectors (0D), capable of measuring a tiny solid angle (typically, a few seconds of a solid radiansor less), used in scanning mode, either by a continuous movement of the motors of the arm on which they are set (and sampling the integrated intensity at predefined time intervals corresponding to typical 2θ steps of 0.001-0.02 ) or in a step-scanning mode, by measuring for a fixed time each fixed 2θ point, sequentially over a large angular range. Sometimes such detectors can be equipped with collimators or even (multi)analyzer crystals that bring the angular resolution down to 0.001 or less, at the cost of a huge loss in intensity. For this reason, (multi)analyzer crystals are usually only installed at synchrotron sourcesSamples Typically constituted by incoherent particles of sizes below 10 μm (down to a few nm for very small nanoparticle specimens), powder samples need to be confined in suitable sample holders, which must not disturb, or affect, the collected data, ideally giving no contribution at all. While this is possible if thick (or, better said, nontransparent to X-rays) specimens are deposited as flat plates in the hollow of a so-called Zero Background Plate (suitably cut silicon or quartz monocrystals) in the Bragg-Brentano geometry (depicted in Fig.Summarizing, without taking into account the many variations which can be devised for samples of different nature (bulk materials, thin films, colloidal suspensions, etc.), for different optical elements geometrically defining, filtering, and monochromatizing the X-ray beam, Table

Key Research Findings 4.1 Bragg Methods of Analysis: An Overview

Crystal Structure Solution:
The determination of the crystal and molecular structure for crystalline materials (inorganic, organic, and organometallic species) has become, in the last 20 years, a pervasive activity; this has been favored by the dissemination of automatic X-ray Sample to detector distance may vary from ca. 150 mm for bench (transportable) X-ray diffractometers to more than 700 mm in large synchrotron setups. Also beam divergence (here exaggerated) can vary, from >1 (in the lab) to less than 0.01 (at synchrotrons) diffractometers, efficient structure solution and refinement software, and, as sad as it can appear, by the quest for low-quality (or low-relevance) papers by newly founded journals accepting, mostly for commerce, nearly all contributions. The tremendous increase of "small molecules" structural knowledge is witnessed by the exponential increase of the structures deposited in the Cambridge Structural DatabaseOf lower numerical impact (less than 0.5 % of the total), crystal structures determined by powder diffraction methods also began to appear in the last decade. Ab initio structural determination by XRPDNoteworthy, structure solution from a single nanocrystal or a collection thereof, by X-ray diffraction methods in the standard Bragg approach (in which the integrated intensities of well-separated peaks, or disentangled overlapping reflections are used as the primary source of information), is not possible, as it turns out to be extremely difficult to deal with extremely broad, and often asymmetric, peaks in reciprocal space, no matter which radiation source (X-ray tubes, rotating anodes, or synchrotrons), diffraction geometry, and X-ray detectors are adopted.Therefore, nearly all X-ray diffraction studies of nanocrystalline matter rely on structural models taken from the bulk, and, whenever possible, only slight modifications of the pertinent parameters [lattice periodicity, stoichiometry and (dis)ordering, thermal agitation] are introduced in model refinement procedures, normally (but not uniquely) performed by least-squares methods in whole-pattern profile matching procedures (the Rietveld methodAccordingly, the final models, derived from initial guess of the structure, heavily depend on what is normally assumed for the bulk structure, only minor modifications being expected. Under these circumstances, we cannot speak of "true" crystal structure solution by diffraction methods (if powders, suspensions, or polycrystalline thin films are employed). However, recent advances in the instrumental and (nano) crystal handling (mounting and centering) have shown that down to the limit of 10 μm 3More importantly, while nanocrystals and nanoparticles are often viewed as small portions of the bulk materials, this has been proven to be an erroneous oversimplification. Numerous studies have shown that even nominally single-phase NPs (e.g., Au, CdSe, PbS, Fe 3 O 4 , etc.) contain core and shell regions that are very different in the atomic order and/or stoichiometry (see, e.g.,

Traditional Methods for Size and Shape Analysis:
As early as 1918, at the verge of the development of diffraction methods for the study of crystalline materials by diffraction methods, Scherrerwhere 2θ is the Bragg angle, λ is the radiation wavelength, and β is the peak breadth, obtained after subtracting the instrumental line broadening, in radians; K is a dimensionless factor, with a typical value of about 0.9 (but varies with the actual shape of the crystallitesfrom 0.62 to 2.08)When crystals possess a significantly anisotropic shape, that is, when their "sizes" cannot be described by a scalar quantity L, a more complex treatment becomes necessary. This is particularly true for platy shaped or acicular materials, which typically show severely broadened peaks in the presence of the narrow(er) ones. Even under the assumptions that these effects are attributed to size effects only (and not to crystal strain or other kind of defectiveness) and that monodisperse crystal size/shapes are present in the actual specimen (both hypotheses being difficult to verify), several numerical techniques have been used to properly model, in reciprocal space, the peak width variability, mostly by a phenomenological approach. Indeed, L is then described by a vectorial approach (i.e., L = L hkl or L = L θϕ , in polar coordinates), for example, by linear combinations of Miller indexes products (as implemented in the GSASThe basic equations for the two approaches are for Stephens' model [24]with H + K + L = 4 and up to 15 independent S HKL coefficients in the triclinic case (symmetry conditions apply for higher symmetry crystal systems), although more simplified versions have been proposed in earlier literature.for spherical harmonics, in Järvinen's formulation [25]with C ij taken as coefficients (set to zero for specific crystal systems) for the real spherical harmonics of even order, Y ij , i = 0, 2, 4, . . . and j = Ài, Ài+1, . . . , i-1, i (as in hydrogen atomic orbitals). Also here, slightly different formulations, relying on alternative algebraic descriptions, have been used. Significantly, a parallel formulation for cubic materials showing high-order "shapes" of a particular property P hkl (say, domain size in nanocrystalline tetrapods, specific crystal morphology inducing textural effects, etc.) exist, in which cubic harmonics K ij (θ hkl ,ϕ hkl ) are used, inwhere k ij are the coefficients, i = 0, 4, 6, 8, . . . (but not 2), j = 1 (only occasionally, 2, in Laue class m-3), and K ij (θ hkl , ϕ hkl ) typically contain polynomials in x n + y n + z n , with n even and 0 n i (x, y, z being the Cartesian coordinates related to θ and ϕ by the usual trigonometric transformations).A more modern approach to size-broadening anisotropy has been proposed by Popa and Balzar,Another popular, though old, method developed for estimating size effects is the Warren-Averbach analysisÞdu, the pure sample-dependent f(x) can be retrieved by using the convolution theorem of Fourier transforms, which turns the Fourier coefficients into simple factors of conventional multiplications. Then, the cosine coefficients of f(x) A n (L) are retained, and, if strain is considered negligible, the plot of A n (L) versus L leads, ideally, to a concave curve (d 2 A n (L)/dL 2 / P(n) > 0, P(n) being the distribution of column lengthsn cells longin the hkl direction). Extrapolation onto the L axis of the line tangent to the A n (L) curve at L = 0 gives <L> a , the sought average area-weighted crystal size. It is however well known that experimental artifacts twist the overall shape of this curve toward an unphysical "hook effect"where d* is the modulus of the diffraction vector in reciprocal space (d* hkl in Bragg conditions); k(d*) includes constant, or known, d*-dependent geometrical and structural terms (Lp, |F| 2 ,absorption, etc.); L is the Fourier length (the conjugate variable of d*); and C(L) can be factorized into terms describing different instrumental and physical effects (nanocrystal size and shape, strain, faults, etc.). This Fourier-based approach is made convenient by the mathematical simplicity of the convolutory approach, which turns into simple multiplication of suitable functions in reciprocal space.In the absence of other broadening sources, the size and shape of crystalline domains (taken as simple convex forms, like a sphere or any other regular solid defined by a unique size parameter Ddiameter or edge) generate an intensity distribution defined byHere, A S (L, D) is the Fourier transform of the diffraction profile, and D 0 hkl is the maximum Fourier length (which depends on the actual shape of the crystal domain).Values of A S (L, D) and D 0 hkl for simple shapes can be computed and can be found in Ref.Finally, a very recent report

An Overview of Traditional Methods for Strain and Defects:
Analysis Size effects are often accompanied, in real materials, by lattice strain and by variable (chemical and metrical) defectiveness. Therefore, a number of tools have been devised to tackle the quantitative determination of the structural parameters defining deviation from ideal periodicity, which, depending on their nature, require specific, and versatile, approaches.A simple and, to some extent, very general use of the peak width variation in reciprocal space, determined by independent profile fitting procedures, and possibly expressed in terms of the integral breadth β (defined above), allows evaluation of size and (micro)strain (the latter being defined as ε = ΔL/L). Taking into account that the size (β L ) and strain (β e ) effects have a different functional dependence on θ, (1/cosθ and tanθ, respectively), and assuming their additivity in breadth β = β L + β e , it is possible to disentangle both contributions, by plotting βcosθ versus sinθ; since βcosθ = kλ/L + 4ε s sinθ (ε s = <ε 2 > 1/2 , the root mean-square strain), the intercept and the slope of the best linear regression allows the derivation of L and ε s . This is the so-called Williamson-Hall method, originally proposed more than 50 years agoAs anticipated, the WPPM approach can include a number of physical effectsother than size and shape, provided that an analytical expression of the Fourier coefficients of the peak broadening is known (both the real and imaginary term contributionsthe A D hkl and iB D hkl termsbecome necessary). To this goal, strain, dislocation, and even twin and deformation faults have been properly included in the WPPM code, following Warren-Averbach (or Stokes-Wilson1D defects are normally related to the presence of planar subunits or slabs of finite thickness, stacking in space along their normal direction, with possible in-plane shifts. Beyond the well-known case of "classical" stacking faults of metals, alloys, and layered metal sulfides (widely treated by Bragg as well as by non-Bragg approaches), other kinds of defects, such as polytypism, antiphase domains, intergrowth, and polysynthetic twinning, can affect several other classes of materials. They include important technological-functional materials such silicon carbide, micas, metal oxides, layered double hydroxides, and, recently, even molecular solids like the drug cimetidineWhole pattern profile matching for faulted materials has also been proposed by Tsybulya et al.

Total Scattering Methods:
Total scattering methods refer to the measurement and the subsequent analysis of the complete diffraction pattern, whichin the case of imperfect crystalline materials, as NPs always arecontains (if we adopt the usual heuristic partition) both elastic scattering contributions coming from the average periodicity (Bragg scattering) and from local nonperiodic deviations from the average (diffuse elastic scattering). These methods were first routinely applied for the analysis of liquid and amorphous systems and only lately to powders of crystalline materials displaying disorder. As explained in Sect. 3.1, in nanocrystalline materials, in addition to the reduced coherent domain size, a large variety of structural defects may be observed, and therefore the application of the total scattering methods is an appropriate way to study such kind of systems disentangling the contribution of the different kinds of defects and quantifying their amount. In any experimental pattern, however, the diffuse scattering produced, by definition, by defects and disorder adds to the unavoidable background produced by the parasitic scattering (e.g., sample holder and air scattering). In the course of a total scattering analysis, it is therefore mandatory either to perform an accurate data correction in order to disentangle the sample scattering from the total observed diffraction pattern or to model and calculate the extrinsic background. For the data correction, nowadays dedicated experimental procedures and software packages have been developed to perform this task, the main ones being GudrunX and PDFGetX3To determine experimentally the absorption coefficients of the sample and sample holder, transmission measurement can be performed before or after the diffraction measurement. PDFGetX3 is quite successful, however, in performing heuristic absorption corrections avoiding those additional measurements.complementary in that the combination of the two methods may be often the best way to get the "full" picture of real NPs.

Direct Space Analysis: The Pair Distribution Function:
The first real space approach in crystal structure determination based on the use of the pair distribution function (PDF) was suggested by Warren in the 1930s

What the PDF Is and How to Obtain It:
The distribution of N point-like atoms at positions r j , j = 1 . . . N, can be described by the atomic local density function n(r)where b j are the atoms' scattering lengths. The autocorrelation function of n(r) provides the atomic pair density function ρ(r)and the latter's spherical average ρ(r) is given byis the pair distribution function (PDF). The PDF is a one-dimensional function that has peaks at positions corresponding to the interatomic distances; thus, it is a histogram-like pattern that, because of the large number of atoms in the crystal, becomes a quasi-continuous distribution function. It therefore provides a very intuitive but essential picture of the structure of the material, which is independent from its ordered state. The fact that atoms (for X-rays at least) are extended objects having a (spherically isotropic) scattering length density leads to complications, however; each term b i b j δ(rÀd ij ) must be replaced by an appropriate function which is the convolution of the densities of the two atoms. This complication is not needed in the case of (elastic nuclear) neutron scattering, for instance, where the scatterers (the nuclei) extend over a few fm, which is much less than the typical diffraction wavelengths (~1 Å), while the electron cloud that scatters X-rays extends over a few Å. Each term still is a peaked function, however less sharp than a Dirac's δ. Analytically it can be very complex, much more so after spherical averaging. A successful simplification is to assume that all atomic density functions are proportional to each other, so the convolution-square profile can be factored out. Moreover, we have to take into account the atomic thermal motion, which further spreads the atomic positions by a Gaussian function with a rms amplitude equal to that of the atomic motion. However, in reciprocal space, the picture is much simpler. In fact, the Fourier transform of ρ(r) is (apart from a trivial factor) the differential cross section (cf. Eq. 10.1)Hereafter we will use the capital variable Q = 2πq (Q = |Q| = 2πq) as much as possible, as it is far more popular, while keeping the lowercase variable for the Fourier transforms as they are much simpler this way. Here we have also reintroduced the Debye-Waller factors T j and the site occupancies o j , in agreement with Eqs. 10.1 and 10.2 (in the following, we will however assume that all the site occupancies o j are 1 so we eliminate them). To see that the equality holds, it is sufficient to write the square modulus in Eq. 10.1 as a double sum, as here. The spherical average of the differential cross section is given in Eq. 10.2, where this operation results simply in the substitution of the complex exponential with (real) sinc functions. Now, as in Eq. 10.2, we can split the double sum in a part (selfscattering) containing only the terms with i = j and another containing all the rest, that is,where we emphasize that the self-scattering is just the average of the squared scattering factors. The Debye-Waller factors T j here have been intentionally dropped, as it is correct, because no thermal motion can change the distance of one atom from itself (i.e., d jj = 0). Now we can define the scattering functionHere, assuming that the fs are proportional to each other, the terms f i f j /<f 2 > are approximately constant (no Q dependence). So we have recovered a situation close to a set of point scatterers. The S(Q) can be obtained directly from the data; the only operations needed are (a) calculating <f 2 > (easily done knowing even approximately the composition of the sample) and (b) evaluating the proper scale factor, which also can be done if the maximum experimental Q is sufficiently high so that S(Q) ~1 in the high Q part of the pattern. In fact, the nontrivial part of S(Q) goes to zero at high Q because of the Debye-Waller factors, which are Gaussians. These tasks can be entrusted to widespread programs, like the above-cited GudrunX and PDFGetX3.Once we have the S(Q), we still need to see what it corresponds to in direct space. We recall the orthogonality relationship between sinc functions:This is obtained recalling that sinc(x) = sin(x)/x is the spherical Bessel function of order 0, j 0 (x) and using the relevant relationshipThis is the most common form of the PDF as a sine-Fourier transform. Another widely used form is g(r) = G(r)/(4πrn 0 ), where n 0 is simply the number density N/V, V being the volume occupied by the NP. There are still two points to be clarified:1. In S(Q)À1 (Eq. 10.4), there appear other Q-dependent factors, namely, the Debye-Waller factor products T i (Q)T j (Q). Their effect is that, instead of a scaled Dirac's δ function as in Eq. 10.5, each sinc term results in a sharp Gaussianwhere <u j 2 > is simply the mean-square thermal oscillation amplitude of atom j. The δ peaks are hence Gaussian-broadened and their width contains information about the thermal motion amplitudes. 2. The integration cannot be extended to 0 and to +1, because of obvious experimental limitations. The most important is the truncation at the maximum experimental Q max value; in fact, if S(Q max )-1 has not substantially reached its asymptotic value (0), fast truncation oscillations result that may obscure the interatomic distance peaks of G(r). The same holds for the truncation at the minimum Q min , with slow oscillations that do not disturb so much. Another consequence of the Q min truncation is that the small-angle (SAXS) signal is almost always entirely lost. This results in a smooth negative baseline for g(r) and G(r) (for g(r) we must subtract a correction term γ 0 (r) and accordingly a term 4πrn 0 γ 0 (r) to G(r)

The Local Structure:
A consolidated trend in modern technology is pointing toward getting more and more structurally complex and/or disordered nanomaterials. Thus, in the context of the structural analysis of such systems, the expression local structure, which refers to the atomic neighboring environment at the length scale of nanometers or less, clearly gets its full meaning and importance. In fact, in a system with very limited size, the modification of the atomic positions and/or composition of even a small part of it is exactly what makes it functional. The structural analysis of such systems clearly cannot be performed on the simplifying assumption of an extended periodic lattice but requires a complex modeling of the many effects determined by the given structural complexity, such as surface relaxation and/or compression, atomic displacement, lattice expansion, contraction and distortion, and interface effect. The following section reports a selection of some recent results in the modeling and analysis of NP systems by the PDF analysis.

Modeling and NP Analysis:
The most popular approach in the PDF analysis probably is the so-called real-space Rietveld, a full-profile fitting method analogous to the Rietveld method but where the function being fit is the PDF, nowadays integrated in well-known software like PDFfit2 and PDFguiThe "real-space Rietveld" approach was used by Michel and coworkersChupas and Chapman have obtained excellent results applying the PDF method to study, in situ, several systems of high-functional relevance like TiO 2 -and Al 2 O 3supported catalytic Pt NPsA further alternative for performing a PDF analysis is shown by the work of Farrow and colleagues

Reciprocal Space Analysis: The Debye Scattering Formula:
Another way of analyzing the XRPD data within the total scattering approach is to build up an atomistic model of the NP(s) in the sample and then use the Debye scattering equation or DSE (Eq. 10.2) to calculate the XRPD diffraction pattern of the model NP system. Upon a good match with the data, one can be satisfied that the model realistically describes the sample. This method has several advantages upon the former:1. The sample can be anything. It can contain one or more kinds of NPs, each distributed in a range of different sizes and shapes. Parameters that depend on the NP dimensions can be accounted for easily; the size dependence of lattice parameters, for instance, can only be analyzed in this waySince reciprocal space modeling is more convenient from the experimental point of view, it allows for a more detailed insight into the microstructure, and especially it is suitable also for complex samples. The drawback is only onecomplexity. First, building atomic-scale models of NPs is not a trivial task. Second, and more importantly, evaluating the Debye scattering equation (Eq. 10.2) where the summation extends on a number of terms that is formally equal to the square of the number of atoms (or the sixth power (!) of the NP diameter) is a daunting endeavor. Nowadays it can be performed also on large-scale atomic ensembles, obtained e.g., from MD simulations

Theory and Implementations in Data Analysis Software Tools:
The problem of evaluating the DSE for large atomic clusters means taking into account a large number of interatomic distances and the associated scattering lengths. Of course, in situations where there is a minimum of symmetry, one expects many of the distances to be exactly the same; therefore, the distances that are equal can be taken as one and the associated scattering lengths summed. This is helpful in cases with high symmetry, but not really a solution, as the number of distances anyway increases as N 2 . However, the freely distributed software DISCUS-Exploiting lattice periodicity for crystalline NPs in order to reduce from the start the number of interatomic distances to be sampled or binned. Take a NP consisting of L lattice points, with each unit cell containing C atoms. Then we first evaluate the distinct interatomic distances between the atoms in the unit cell; these will be at most C 2 /2, often much less depending on cell symmetry. The distances between lattice points will be at most 8 L (4 L taking inversion symmetry into account), because of a fundamental property of lattices (the distance vectors between the lattice points limited by a finite region of space are just the lattice points contained in a doubly extended space region) See-Chemical disorder, represented as site occupancy disorder, where the probability that an atom in a given site is smaller than one, is already intrinsically implemented in the DSE (Eq. 10.2), and it is a simple matter to factor out the occupancy factors o j . Then they can be changed and refined separately. Correlation between occupancy of neighbor sites must be taken into account separately, however, depending on the nature of the interaction. In its simple form, alternative occupation of sites that are too close together to be simultaneously occupied can be taken into account (exactly!) by lower-thresholding the interatomic distances and "shifting" those that are too short to the "self-scattering" term (see Sect. 3.2.1), omitting, of course, the sinc and T factors, as it is appropriate. -Fast transform of a sampled scattering density having a uniform step Δ.Details are given inDebussy

Characterization of Different Classes of Materials and Complex Systems:
Most of the recent pertinent literature reports on the Debye function analysis of noble metals and semiconductors, in the characterization of small defective nanoparticles investigationCharacterization of Magnetite-Maghemite Core-Shell NPs in the 5-15 nm Size Regime Thanks to their peculiar magnetic properties, iron oxide NPs are materials of great interest in many technological (high-density storage media, ferrofluids, electronic devices, catalysis) and biomedical applications (magnetic resonance imaging, hyperthermia, targeted drug delivery)The pattern modeling was performed by applying the two-stage strategy of the Debussy Suite and three main computational steps: (1) atomistic models of pure Fe 3 O 4 nanocrystals of spherical shape were generated ending up with the sampled interatomic distances of a discrete population of NPs of increasing size, Δr of subsequent spheres being equal to %0.33 nm; (2) pattern simulations were calculated by assuming a lognormal size-distribution function with adjustable average size (<D>) and width (σ), a size dependence for the lattice parameter, atomic Debye-Waller factors, and sof of Fe in the octahedral site [Fe(oct)]; (3) model parameters were optimized through the simplex methodThe magnetization (M) curves versus applied field (H) at 2 and 300 K are shown for the 10 nm-sized B9 and the 20 nm-sized C3 samples in Fig.To complete this paragraph dedicated to the DFA of iron oxide NPs, we present an overall general law, with a single adjustable parameter (Ω):where Ω = 4γ/(3Β), γ is the surface tension, B the bulk modulus, and x = 3(<3Àδ>À 8) (x = 0 for maghemite and x = 1 for magnetite). This law has been derived from the entire ensemble of NPs, under the main assumption that the surface conditions of all particles in all samples are identical. In such a case, the lattice parameter variations due to stoichiometry and to particle size can be usefully combined, taking into account the interplay between bulk elastic energy and surface tensionInvestigating the Role of Citrate in Biomimetic Apatite Nanoparticles Biomineralization is the very complex process by which living organisms assemble organic-inorganic composites, typically forming structures with hierarchical organizations able to show exceptional functional properties and aptitude to adaptationSynchrotron X-ray scattering data (collected at the X04SA-MS of SLS using a beam energy of 16 KeV and 0.5 mm glass capillaries) were processed by the DFA, adopting a three-component model: the crystal structure of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA)From a modeling point of view, it is useful for the reader to have more details about how we managed the platy morphology without introducing a trivariate sizedistribution function, which in itself is too complex to be extracted from even the best possible diffraction data. We firstly generated the population of hexagonal prisms through a layer-by-layer construction and under the assumption of two independent "growth" directions, one along the sixfold symmetry c-axis and the second one in the orthogonal ab plane, up to 15 nm in ab and 50 nm along c. In order to deal with the platy CDHA shapes, bivariate populations, addressed by L c along c, and, in ab, by anisotropic parallelogram-shaped bases with fixed 1:2 a/b ratio, were built. These populations were used together with the hexagonal base prisms previously defined and constrained to the same NC size distribution and stoichiometry values, in a biphasic (crystalline) pattern model. Such a combination of hexagonal and platy shapes is a way to approximate a trivariate size distribution through estimation of the shape anisotropy of the ab-base (in addition to the anisotropy due to the crystal elongation in the c-axis direction), without introducing too many unnecessary parameters. Such anisotropy can be measured by the ratio A of the base polygon principal inertia moments (in our model, A = 1 for the hexagonal base, A = 6.17 for the platelet base). Since this measure is linear in the mass fraction, an effective average base anisotropy <A> was derived through the mass fractions of the two populations, hexagonal and platelet (normalized to the total crystalline components, which differ only for the anisotropy of the ab-base shape). Therefore, mass fractions % reported in the table of Fig.For the investigated samples, the DFA provided the following: (i) the relative abundance of ACP and hexagonal-/platy-shaped CDHA (table of Fig.

Size and Shape Dependence of the Photocatalytic Activity of TiO 2 Nanocrystals:
The excellent photochemical activity of nanosized titanium dioxide crystals have attracted the interest of many for their potential applications in fields such as solar-energy capture, air and water pollutant decontamination, watersplitting reactions, and fabrication of smart textilesAll TiO 2 samples showed the evident trace of nanocrystalline anatase and, in the A-and B-type samples, a small amount of brookite (already evidenced by others in analogous preparations). Accordingly, bivariate sets of atomistic clusters of increasing size were created for anatase (sizes up 15 nm in the ab plane and 30 nm along the c-axis) and for brookite (up to 6 and 10 nm in ab and along c, respectively). Due to the importance, in this study, of the NCs aspect ratio, it is worth noting that the choice of prismatic crystals approximated by a simple square prism, although each NCs in our samples is expected to have its own shape, is justified by two main reasons: (1) the level of shape information that can reliably be extractedas a statistical distributionis the prism aspect ratio, as long as the principal axes of the base remain comparable, and finer details are likely lost in the experimental trace and (2) the crystal symmetry. For anatase (in agreement with the space-group I4 1 /amd and a recent report on NCs shape different from the bipyramidal morphology of macroscopic crystals), the chosen polyhedron might not be very far from reality. For brookite, the orthorhombic space group (Pbca) suggested us to use a trick: we permuted the axes of the ICSD entry 36408, in order to have c as the longest axis and a and b of nearly equal lengths, further treated by a common growth parameter to match the bivariate size-distribution model.The most relevant findings of this analysis are summarized in Fig.Amorphous-Crystalline Interplay in SiO 2 -TiO 2 Nanocomposites One of the most appealing goal in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology is designing multifunctional nano-objects able to synergistically combine distinct properties of individual components. Crystalline-amorphous composites are among the most interesting hybrids. Those combining amorphous silica and titanium dioxide NPs are of relevance for preparing materials with excellent photocatalytic activity (from the crystalline titania NPs) and remarkable adsorption properties (from the porous silica), in order to overcome the relatively low surface area of pure titania NPs, as required, for example, in environmental applications (wastewater and air pollution)Sol-gel SiO 2 /TiO 2 composites were prepared at low temperature (80 C) by tuning the Si/Ti molar ratios (50:50, 65:35, and 80:20) and the samples aging time (24, 48, and 120 h). When embedded in an amorphous silica (am-SiO 2 ) matrix, the growth of pure anatase is favored, as we observed also in our samples. These systems were investigated through a combination of the DFA approach and the radial distribution function (RDF) methodThe RDF analysis enabled us to investigate the sample amorphous component, once we realized that the corresponding calculated traces (provided by the Debussy as separate signals) did not exactly match the experimental patterns of pure SiO 2 (see Fig.

Defects and Strain Analysis in Nanoparticles and Nanomaterials:
We here focus on the most relevant structural defects occurring in nanocrystalline materials, which are intended as deviations of the atomic arrangement from ideally periodic repetition of a unit cell content. As already mentioned in Sect. 4.1.3 for ä Fig.A highly sophisticated model of closed-packed fcc and hcp sequences, where four-layer blocks influence in a probabilistic way the occurrence of the next layer, has been very recently proposed by Longo et al.A more general approach to stacking faults (but not only) has been implemented in the DISCUS suite of programs, which allows simulation, and refinement, of complex user-defined systems, at the expense of extremely long CPU usage and intense programming. Specifically, DISCUS can generate disordered atomic structures and compute the corresponding single crystal or powder diffuse scattering, both the Debye pattern simulation and the full atomic pair distribution function (PDF), with the aid of powerful Monte Carlo simulation capabilities and the generation of nanoparticles domain structures. Sophisticated imperfections in the lattice such as strain, fault probabilities, and relaxation effects, in particular at the NP surface (surface relaxation effects), can be also refined, besides fundamental properties (size, anisotropic shape, and atomic structure), by means of an evolutionary algorithm. DISCUS approach is reported mainly for II-VI semiconductor NPs. A nice application to thioglycerol-stabilized ZnO nanoparticles can be found inA more complex multiple twinning effect is typically observed in noble metal NPs (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd), whose applications span from catalysis to optoelectronic and surface plasma resonance properties, therefore covering many fields of interest. At very small sizes, noble metal NPs are known to form particles having decahedral and icosahedral symmetry, that is, atomic arrangements that the simple fcc unit cell of the corresponding bulk material is not able to describe, due to the occurrence of unconventional crystallographic features (like the presence of local fivefold symmetry axes)Other classes of defective nanomaterials feature the formation of 2D defects. This is the case of rod-shaped subunits, or extended polymeric chains, which typically arrange in parallel bundles, with stronger interactions within one direction than perpendicularly to it. Ideally, the extreme uncorrelated disorder is found in purely nematic phases, as found in several technologically relevant liquid crystalline phasesOn the same line, and driven by the similarity of the crystal packing energy of parallel and antiparallel chains of piano-stool molecules, falls the organometallic Cp*ReO 3 molecule (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadiene)As the final example of this paragraph, we discuss a paracrystalline approach to strain, which we proposed in a recent paper, aiming at defining specific microstructural features showing up, in the diffraction traces, as a not easily predictable peak broadening effect, not monotonic with θ, nor (apparently) determined by a simple (continuous) hkl dependence. This has been observed in a number of coordination polymers (Ru(CO) 4 ,where d is the vector separating two chains (in ab), r a and s a are the so-called longitudinal and transversal correlation coefficients, and m and n are the distance (in lattice units) of the pertinent chain. σ a is the limiting statistical variance (i.e., the maximum amplitude of uncorrelated shifts) of the packing periodicity along the a axis. Deviation of r a and s a from unity represents the loss of correlation for moieties lying along a and for the laterally displaced ones, respectively. A similar approach was used to investigate the more complex structural features of [Ag(4-NO 2 -pz)] 3 and [Cu(4-NO 2 -pz)] 3 (4-NO 2 -pz = 4-nitropyrazolate) in which the phenomenon of correlated shifts and faulted stacking of trimeric molecules of D 3h idealized geometry were found to simultaneously happen

Conclusions and Future PerspectivesIn the complex field of NP characterization, XRPD stands as a fundamental pillar. It is a very old and very simple experimental method that is enjoying a new Renaissance because of constant improvements and incremental advances. These are due mainly to progress in instrumentation, especially at synchrotrons but also, very importantly, at the laboratory scale. XRPD is suited to almost every conceivable sample, from laboratory-created ideal samples to real-world wall scrapings, and the preparation requirementsapart from producing the sample itself, of courseare minimal. It is also a nondestructive tool and is well suited to follow sample evolution in non-ambient conditions. It is also fundamentally a "tail-heavy" method: data as collected are not immediately meaningful, and a more or less complex analysis procedure must be carried out to obtain the desired information. This makes XRPD a medal with two faces. The ugly face is that, even after the experiment has been successfully completed, most of the work must still be done. This is at variance with other methodsfor instance, electron microscopythat yield immediately understandable data. Note, however, that the process of inspecting and extracting information out of a large set of EM micrographs can be as burdensome or even more when some statistical information is needed. XRPD data contain already the properly averaged information, because a XRPD pattern contains signals from huge numbers of single NPs. The happy face is that the information contained in a XRPD pattern, and that is possible to extract there from, is quite large, as it is spread on a range of different scales, from the fine details of the atomic structure to microstructure effects that range up to the scale of NP size, which is several orders of magnitude larger. Depending on the sought-for information and on the nature of the system, various analysis methods can be applied which yield surprisingly detailed results. As the information is extracted from a simple 1D graph (the diffraction pattern), it is often a good ruleby common senseto seek for at least partial confirmation of the results obtained by other methods, either imaging or spectroscopic or analytical methods. Nevertheless, the power of the XRPD technique is amazing, even being so simple and almost rough as experiment, being however able to supply detailed knowledge about very dirty and complex matter. As future perspectives, the availability and development of data analysis software stands up in front. The number, kind, and capability of analytical programs available for XRPD is increasing constantly, eventually reducing, in the near future, the burden of data analysis. On the other hand, broad instrumental improvement is still expected in the medium term, on laboratory equipment, as well as on dedicated synchrotron beamlines, the former exploiting the technological fallout of the later. A larger step forward will happenis happeningas the new FEL X-ray sources come on line. In one of the many new applications of FELs, powder diffraction patterns are obtained by illuminating one by one with the FEL particles traveling in a jet. This extends the applicability of the method to materials that are not suited for conventional XRPD because of their tendency to coalesce or react whenever stuffed together in a confined volume. Again, a new infancy for this centenary method?.1 Definition of the Topic X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) is an absorption spectroscopy which provides the material local structure with a bond distance of less than sub-A ˚precision. It does not require any long-range order nor special environment. Therefore, it is the suitable technique to characterize the catalytic nanomaterials under working conditions. This chapter presents an overview of the principle, emerging technology, and applications of XAFS in characterizing nanomaterials in catalysis.

Overview:
Catalysts are materials that accelerate the reaction rate. The structure characterizations are difficult using diffraction methods because catalysts are often used as nanoclusters highly dispersed on oxide surfaces. In addition, the structures before, during, and after catalytic reactions are different from each other, and the in situ observation techniques of catalyst structures are highly required. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) method is the most appropriate technique to investigate the catalyst nanomaterial structure under working conditions. We will review the history and principle of XAFS, followed by experimental setup and preparation of the sample. The analysis of XAFS will be briefly described, where the error estimations using Hamilton ratio method are discussed. We will mention its application to nanoparticles -monometallic and bimetallic under reaction conditions. We also describe the two emerging technologies in XAFS, called as ultrafast timeresolved XAFS and polarization-dependent total reflection fluorescence XAFS (PTRF-XAFS), which can provide new structural information we never have had with other characterization methods. Finally, we discuss its future perspective. IntroductionCatalysts are materials that accelerate chemical reactions which are widely used to create energies and new materials as well as improve the environment. Catalysts may be divided into three categories: molecular, heterogeneous, and biocatalysts. Molecular catalysts and biocatalysts function primarily in solution, and their active site structures are often determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or by X-ray crystallography following crystallization from a solvent. Heterogeneous catalysts, in contrast, represent active species (primarily in a metallic state) dispersed on solid surfaces. Metal nanoclusters are particularly important as heterogeneous catalysts. In these materials, optimal catalytic performance is typically obtained through intimate contact between the metal nanoclusters and its solid support, and so the catalyst has to be characterized in its supported form. The present review focuses on such heterogeneous catalysts, in which the surface nanostructure is crucial. These materials do not exhibit long-range order and hence are not readily analyzed via X-ray crystallography. Electron microscopy, however, is a good candidate for the characterization of these catalysts, since it allows assessment of the morphologies of nanomaterials, as well as the atomic locations, in addition to chemical analysis on the nano-level as the result of newer developments in spherical aberration correction techniquesIn this chapter, we discuss the applications of X-ray absorption spectroscopy to the analysis of catalytic materials, in particular the use of X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). XAFS is a unique technique that provides useful information about both bond lengths and ligands. The XAFS phenomenon was first observed by Fricke in 1920Figurewhere Io, I t , and t are the incident and transmitted X-ray intensities and the thickness of the sample, respectively. As the sample is irradiated with X-rays whose energy is scanned, μ abruptly increases at energy values specific to elements. This energy for a given element is known as its absorption edge and results from excitation of core electrons to unoccupied states and to the vacuum level (equal to the Fermi level in a solid) to generate free electrons or photoelectrons. The 1s, 2s, 2p 1/2 , and 2p 3/2 core electron energy levels are the most often used and are termed the K-, L 1 -, L 2 -, and L 3 -edges, respectively. XAFS provides information concerning local electronic states and geometric structures around the X-ray-absorbing atom. The absorption spectrum near the edge (À10 to 50 eV) is complicated and is referred to as X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) where excited electrons are trapped by unoccupied states and/or undergo multiple scattering by surrounding atoms. On the other hand, the fine structures appearing more than 50 eV are referred to as extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) which results from the interference between outgoing photoelectrons and the electrons backscattered by the surrounding atoms, as shown in Fig.The scattering in the EXAFS region can be explained in a simple manner by considering that the oscillation associated with a single-scattering event has a sinusoidal waveform, as expressed in Eq. (11.Here, F(k), Φ(k), N, σ, r, λ, and S 0 2 are the backscattering amplitude, phase shift function, coordination number, Debye-Waller factor or mean square displacement, bond length measured for the X-ray-absorbing atom, mean free path length, and amplitude reduction factor. The term k represents the wave number of the photoelectron calculated fromwhere m, hν, and E B are mass of electron, photon energy, and binding energy of core electron, respectively. EXAFS is sensitive to the local structure around the X-ray-absorbing atom and thus allows the specific structural analysis of elements by selecting a particular atom. The resulting EXAFS oscillation has a sinusoidal form against k such that the Fourier transform of the data generates a pseudo-radial distribution function in which the peaks correspond roughly to specific bonds. The exact bond length and coordination number are determined through curve fitting analysis in the r-space or k-space using the theoretically or empirically determined phase shift and background amplitude functions. The advantage of XAFS is that it does not require the sample to be in a particular form, and thus it is applicable to noncrystalline materials such as liquids and amorphous substances. Therefore, XAFS can be employed to determine the local structures of catalyst nanoclusters deposited on support surfaces.A further advantage of XAFS is that it allows in situ analysis in the presence of various ambient gases, since the X-rays readily penetrate the gas phase. This is important with regard to the structural analysis of catalysts, since their structures may differ before, during, and after reaction.Below, we discuss the applications of XAFS to the analysis of nanoparticle catalysts, in particular in situ and time-resolved XAFS studies, beginning with a summary of the history of XAFS and the associated experimental apparatus. In addition, a single-crystal oxide system using polarization-dependent XAFS capable of providing three-dimensional (3D) structures is considered.

Experimental and Instrumental for XAFS Measurements XAFS spectra can be acquired in several modes -transmission, fluorescence, and electron yield -and choosing the appropriate mode for a given experiment is crucial. Here, we briefly describe the transmission mode, which is the most fundamental mode and also the most frequently used. The first step of any XAFS measurement is sample preparation, and here, there are three important factors: a suitable edge jump value, a suitable absorption coefficient, and sample uniformity. The total absorbance of a sample at the target wavelength can be calculated from the X-ray absorption cross sectionsXAFS cells for holding liquid or powdered samples can be prepared rather simply by drilling a hole (several millimeters in diameter) and milling a slot in a plate of an appropriate material, such as a plastic, Teflon ® , or a metal. To allow for a vacuum, threaded, sealable plugholes must also be included. Finally, a pair of thin Kapton ® films may be affixed to either side of the cell as windows. The optimal window thickness is approximately 250 μm but will vary somewhat depending on the absorption energy of the target element. If the sample has to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures, the cell should be made of a material that exhibits good thermal conductivity, such as Cu or Al, and will require sufficient thermal contact, such as through an indium foil, with the cold finger of a helium cryostat.To allow the measurement of small variations in the absorption coefficient μ(E) in EXAFS spectra, the data acquisition process must generate an S/N ratio better than 10 3 in the region from 600 to 1000 eV above the absorption edge. As well, in order to resolve XANES features, the energy resolution of the X-ray beam should be less than 1 eV. Synchrotron radiation is an ideal light source for XAFS since it is able to provide 10 10 photons/s with a small angular spread.A typical configuration for transmission XAFS measurements is shown in Fig.In order to obtain reliable results from EXAFS, it is important to acquire spectra using the largest possible k-range. The EXFAS equation implies that experimental data collected up to a high k max will increase the number of independent fitting parameters as the available k-range (Δk) increases. As a result, we can reduce the correlation between the parameters N i and σ i , as will be discussed in the analysis section. Moreover, this allows improved discrimination between close peaks during the Fourier transform. The distance resolution in an EXAFS spectrum, ΔR, is expressed asTherefore, a measurement requires a Δk value of approximately 16 A ˚À1 if two peaks for which ΔR = 0.1 A ˚are to be resolved by the Fourier transform.

XAFS Analysis:
As described in the "Introduction," EXAFS data allow analysis of the types of surrounding atoms and their structural parameters, including coordination numbers, bond lengths, and disorder. In contrast, the electronic states and symmetry of nanomaterials are obtained from the XANES region. In this section, we describe a standard data analysis procedure. Many EXAFS data analysis software packages are currently availableHere, the EXAFS oscillation is summed over the ith shell.The standard EXAFS analysis procedure involves fitting the experimental data to determine a structural model, using Eq.Since the original kinetic energy of the photoelectron in the unknown compound, E 0 , is not always equal to the value used in the calculation of the phase shift and backscattering amplitude functions or that of the reference compound, it is necessary to adjust ΔE i0 during the curve fitting process.The overall data analysis process is described by the flow chart presented in Fig.The first step is the estimation of the energy threshold, E 0 , in which the first inflection point on the edge is typically used. Another means of approximating E 0 is to use the halfway point of the absorption edge jump. Rough estimations such as these are sufficient because the value of E 0 will be further refined during the curve fitting analysis. The EXAFS oscillation, χ(k), is obtained from the measured, where μ bkg (E) is the smooth portion of the absorption coefficient in the post edge region. The postedge smooth curve can be obtained by polynomial fitting, moving average, cubic spline, and smoothing splineEXAFS spectra consist of sums of damped sine waves corresponding to longer path lengths. The EXAFS data are weighted by k 1 or k 3 so as to emphasize the contributions of low or high Z (atomic number) neighbors, respectively. These weighted spectra are Fourier transformed to r-space. Since the EXAFS oscillation is the sum of sinusoidal curves, the Fourier transform generates peaks at positions corresponding to the atom locations. The heights of these Fourier transform peaks represent the average k n -weighted EXAFS amplitudes and are affected by the scattering atoms, the k-weighting, and the Fourier transform windows. The Fourier transform will have real and imaginary parts, although only the modulus of the Fourier transform is given in the literature. It is noteworthy that this modulus includes no phase information and will give unusual peaks if two shells are close to one another. In this case, it is recommended to present both the modulus and the imaginary part because these data are helpful with regard to distinguishing between true and ghost peaks by comparison of the imaginary partIt should be noted that the position of the peak in r-space is shifted to shorter side by approximately 0.2-0.4 A ˚because of the negative slope of the phase shift function. Both accurate bond lengths and other structural parameters can be obtained by curve fitting procedures. This curve fitting analysis depends on the proposed model structures, meaning the pairs of absorbing-neighboring atoms chosen for analysis. The credibility of the data fitting relies on appropriate knowledge of the target system's chemical composition, which has been obtained by other techniques. Prior to the curve fitting, however, the F i (k i ) and Φ i (k i ) functions must be obtained. There are two approaches. The first employs experimentally derived phase shifts and backscattering amplitudes extracted from the EXAFS data for reference compounds. These experimental standards are generally not complex but must be carefully prepared and handled, since the usefulness of the data they provide depends on the quality of the standard compound and the separation of the target atomic pairs from other neighbors in the standard compound. The sample purity has an especially direct effect on the credibility of the resulting data, and it is thus recommended to use a simple compound in which there is a single neighboring atom that has a single interatomic distance and for which the purity has been ascertained by X-ray diffraction. Another approach is to use a theoretical standard generated using a computer program such as FEFF, GNXAS, or EXCURVE. These theoretical standards can include multiple scattering if higher coordination shells are analyzed. Thus, if one wishes to analyze a complex system, the theoretical approach is desirable. Although the reliability of the theoretical approach has improved, it is necessary to apply these theoretical functions to the analysis of EXAFS data for standard compounds to evaluate their validity.The EXAFS data will be fitted in k-space or r-space with the appropriate fitting parameters. The goodness of fit is estimated from the associated R factor , expressed by the following equation:where χ i experiment (k), χ i fit (k), and [α] are the experimental data, the theoretical fitted data, and the fitting parameters, respectively. The goodness of fit can often be estimated using the chi-square (χ 2 ) test, as in Eq. (11.7), below. Here, we use R ν instead of χ:Here, N, n, and ε i represent the number of data points used for data fitting, the number of fitting parameters, and the error of the ith data point. M is the degrees of freedom estimated from the Nyquist theorem, as follows:where Δk and Δr are the k and the r window widths, respectively. Although Stern proposed a value of 2 for mWhen |R ν | 2 is less than 1, the fitting is accepted, while a value greater than 1 signifies that the fitting is not acceptable. Although the χ 2 -test is the most reasonable and absolute criterion for the goodness of fit, it is difficult to apply in practice because the error (ε i 2 ) estimation (especially the systematic error estimation) for each data point is difficult.In contrast, the R factor is calculated using Eq.Here, we consider two examples in which the Hamilton test is employed.

(Example 1) Error Estimation:
In this example, a curve fitting analysis is performed for which Δk = 3-15 A ˚À1 . The Fourier filtering range is Δr = 1-2 A ˚with four adjustable parameters, N, r, ΔE, and σ, and the R for the best fit value is R 1 = 0.02. What, then, is the error in r? In this example, the r term is fixed at a value slightly different from the optimal value, r + Δr, and the other three parameters are optimized. Here, b = 1 since r is fixed. A value of R 2 = 0.03 is then obtained. In this case, M = 2 ΔrΔk/π = 8. In the initial optimization process, we used n = 4 parameters such that 4 (=(M À n)) degrees of freedom were left. When estimating the error bar at the 10 % significance level, the Hamilton ratio R 1, 4, 0:1 ¼ 1:462 is approximately equal to 0.03/ 0.02 = 1.5. Thus, at the 10 % significance level, the error bar should be Δr.( One of the most fundamental goals of nanoparticle (NP) studies is to understand the factors governing the 3D arrangements of atoms and their geometry in the NPs. A practical advantage of EXAFS is its sensitivity to the partial radial distribution function of the absorbing atoms and their neighbors within the local range (about 6A ˚). Due to the finite size effect, the differences between NPs and the bulk material produce dramatic changes in EXAFS results, including a reduced amplitude due to smaller coordination numbers and a different oscillation period due to the change in bond lengths compared to those in the bulk. In addition, important information concerning the disorder in NPs is also derived from EXAFS spectra. During the last decade, the combination of different structural analysis techniques, such as high-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM), high-energy XRD, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, with EXAFS has allowed quantification of the number of atoms in NPs, as well as visualization of their geometry on the sub-nm to 2-3 nm size range.

Monometallic Nanoparticles:
In this subsection, we review general analysis strategies and discuss recent studies in which the quantitative geometric properties of monometallic nanoparticles (MMNPs) have been elucidated. A number of studies aimed at understanding both ligand-protected and oxidesupported MMNPs have been reported. The majority of these MMNPs possess a high degree of symmetry and their sizes and properties can be controlled by various synthetic approaches. As such, a regular polyhedron (including cuboctahedral, icosahedral, truncated decahedral, truncated octahedral, and hexagonal close packing) is a good approximation of a nanocluster. Many of these nanoclusters have a closed shell that are often characterized by "magic numbers" of metal atoms, as shown in Fig.The strategies for elucidating the sizes and shapes of symmetrical MMNPs from EXAFS data can be roughly categorized as either the single-scattering (SS) or multiple-scattering (MS) path approach. The SS path approach allows determination of the first nearest coordination numbers (N 1st ) of regular clusters (i.e., symmetrical nanoclusters). Montejano-Carrizales et al. have analytically characterized several regular polyhedral clusters as a function of the cluster size L (defined as L = N E À1, where N E is the number of atoms along the edge of a regular polyhedron)In contrast, Calvin et al. used a simple sphere with radius R for approximation purposes and obtained the value of N 1st by the following equation:where r is the average bond length associated with the N 1st for the nanocluster and N 1st bulk is the first coordination number for the bulkFrenkel et al. have proposed a means of discriminating between models with different atomic packing and morphologyHere, n is the number of identical atoms in a nanocluster, Q i (r) is the partial RDF for atom i, and dn i is the number of neighbors within a spherical shell of thickness dR i . The coordination numbers (N 1st , N 2nd , N 3rd ) within a given shell in a model cluster can be estimated usingAnother important factor in the EXAFS analysis of NPs is the effect of disorder in the NP structure, as reflected in the Debye-Waller factor σ 2 , since this disorder attenuates the EXAFS oscillations and may produce misleading data concerning the coordination number and thus lead to incorrect conclusions during nanocluster modeling. The σ 2 effect can be expressed as the simple sum of static and thermal (or dynamic) terms, as in Eq.A simple and practical means of reducing the thermal term is to acquire the EXAFS oscillations at cryogenic temperature.The growth mechanisms and the resulting structures of nanoclusters under synthesis conditions such as H 2 reduction are also highly important issues in nanocluster studies. However, the disorder expressed by the Debye-Waller factor σ 2 directly affects the amplitude of EXAFS oscillations at higher temperatures. Therefore, it is important to select a reliable means of eliminating the correlation between σ 2 and S 0 2 or N. Correlated Einstein and Debye models are both commonly used to analyze thermal σ 2 terms. Sevillano et al., however, recommend the Debye model for nearly isotropic systems since this approach is both simple and reliableRoldan et al. estimated the Debye temperature of ligand-free, size-and shapeselected Pt NPs supported on γ-Al 2 O 3 , based on the correlated Debye modelIn addition to changes in the Debye-Waller factors for NPs, it is important to consider the apparent contraction of lengths due to the asymmetric radial distribution effect. The EXAFS formula given in Eqs.  (Reproduced with permission from Ref.Here, the bond lengths are shortened due to the influence of the k 3 term. In the case of a moderately non-Gaussian system, therefore, Eq. (11.12) may be used. Yokoyama et al. reported that Pt NPs stabilized in NaY showed a shorter bond length after cumulant corrections had been applied

Bimetallic Nanoparticles:
Fundamental Conditions Required for the Analysis of Bimetallic Nanoparticles Several equations must be satisfied to allow for the analysis of bimetallic NPs. A bimetallic nanocluster is composed of two different elements, A and B, and the EXAFS oscillations correspond to the bond lengths and coordination numbers of both elements. In the analysis of bimetallic systems, therefore, several conditions must be satisfied, as follows1. The bond length determined for element A (R AB ) equals that determined for B (R BA ). 2. The coordination numbers determined for elements A and B satisfy the following relation:where C A and C B are, respectively, the molar coefficients of elements A and B in the chemical formula of the compound, which can be determined by chemical analysis using inductively coupled plasma (ICP), X-ray fluorescence, and other techniques.If the above two conditions are not satisfied within the limits of error, the reliability of the results are in doubt.In principle, the absolute values for the Debye-Waller factor as determined from each XAFS oscillation should be equal to one another within the limits of error. However, determination of the absolute value of the Debye-Waller factor can be challenging and so this is not always the case. However, if a reference compound containing the same atomic pair is analyzed, the difference between the squares of the Debye-Waller factors for the reference and unknown compounds at the two edges shown in Eq.Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) may be roughly classified into two categories, as shown in Fig.

Alloyed Nanoparticles:
Alloy nanoparticles may be classified as either random or ordered. In a random alloy, the ratio of the coordination numbers of homoatomic and heteroatomic pairs should equal the component ratio. However, an ordered alloy has a definite coordination number ratio derived from its ordered structure. For example, in bulk Cu 3 Au, each Cu atom is surrounded by four Au and eight Cu atoms, while Au is completely surrounded by Cu. FePt has an ordered metallic form known as L1 0 , and Shinoda et al. have prepared FePt nanoparticles using a polyol processPhase transitions may also occur as the result of gas-phase absorptionThe coordination numbers in TablePdCu is known to form intermetallic compounds or ordered alloys such as Pd 3 Cu or PdCu. In the case of PdCu NPs, the structure is intermediate between a random and an ordered alloy due to the mobile character of the atoms in the NPs. Although an ordered alloy might be more stable than a random alloy, smaller particles will have more mobile atoms, especially at the surface, such that the entropy factor may concur with the energy term. The balance between an intermetallic compound and a solid solution may be quite subtle. PtRu nanoparticles, heated to 1173 K and rapidly cooled to RT, form a random alloy

Segregated Nanoparticles:
In the case of a segregated cluster, the coordination numbers for homoatomic pairs are larger than those for heteroatomic pairs. These structures can be further divided into core-shell and cluster-in-cluster types. The "core" of the core-shell structure gives a total coordination number nearly equal to the bulk value, while the coordination numbers for the atoms in the "shell" are lower than the bulk value because the surface atoms are less coordinated. A cluster-in-cluster structure is formed when each element initially forms clusters of like atoms, following which these clusters agglomerate to form larger clusters. Clusters of both atoms may be located on the surface, and hence the total coordination numbers are less than those in the bulk, and the coordination number for the homoatomic pair is larger than that for the heteroatomic pair.PtAu bimetallic nanoclusters have been prepared by the deposition of Pt onto Au nanoclusters previously prepared through a sputter deposition techniqueIn the case of both Pt and Au edges, homoatomic pairs were more favorable than heteroatomic pairs, such that N Pt-Pt , N Au-Au > N Pt-Au , N Au-Pt , indicating a segregated structure. The total numbers of atoms around the Pt and Au atoms were 9.2 and 12.4, respectively, demonstrating a Pt shell with a Au core. TablePtPd NPs supported on SiO 2 with various compositions were prepared from PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone)-protected bimetallic nanoclustersThe coordination numbers of the homoatomic pair were larger than expected from the composition and random alloy model, indicating the segregation structure. However, the total coordination numbers of Pd and Pt were less than 12, indicating not a core-shell but a cluster-in-cluster-type structure

Principles of the In Situ XAFS Cell:
The structure of a cell strongly depends on the X-ray energy, the reaction phase or atmosphere (vacuum, gas, or liquid), and the temperature. Since the cell is usually made on a smaller size scale than a realistic reactor and tuned to obtain the best spectrum, the chemical state of a catalyst might not be the same as in an actual reactor even if the temperature, gas atmosphere, and reaction time are finely adjusted. Therefore, to understand the catalysis more accurately, simultaneous evaluation of the catalytic performance is very important. The use of a conventional product analysis technique such as gas chromatography (GC) during the reaction would be one means of simultaneously evaluating the catalytic activity, although the time required for each analysis could be as long as 20-30 min, which is much longer than the time required for an XAFS measurement (less than 1 min per  Values in parentheses indicate the coordination numbers derived from core-shell and cluster-incluster models, respectivelyIn Situ XAFS Cell for Gas-Phase Reactions over Solid Catalysts When the sample is a solid and is well suited to analysis by transmission mode XAFS and the reaction is conducted in the gas phase, the design of the cell is very simple, and two types of cell are usually used. One type has almost the same structure as cells used for other spectroscopic analyses, such as IR spectroscopy (Fig.In the case of the type I cell, the body is made of glassThe type II cell is similar to the tubular reactors used for catalytic reaction tests. As shown in Fig.In Situ XAFS Cell for Liquid-Phase Reactions over Solid Catalysts Liquid-phase reactions are also vital in the chemical industry, and so it is important to investigate the structural changes of catalysts under working conditions in order to determine the active phases and to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Compared to gas-phase reactions, cell designs for solid catalysts in liquids require special concepts for windows because of the higher X-ray absorption and heat conductivity of liquids. The same type II cells used for gas-phase reactions may be employed, but with some modifications. Recently, an experiment with supercritical water was reported in which an AlN tube was used as the cellWhen a type I cell is used for liquid-phase reactions, the windows must be set close to the sample, as shown in Fig.In such cases, it is impossible to avoid direct contact of heated reactants with the windows, and therefore the window materials must be able to withstand high temperatures and pressures, as well as certain chemicals. Beryllium can meet all these requirements and so it has been used to form X-ray windows, although it is toxic when inhaled or absorbed through the skin, and so careful handling is necessary, such as working in a ventilation hood with plastic glovesWhen studying reactions in which solid catalysts are suspended in a liquid, the catalysts should be kept uniformly mixed to allow for suitable XAFS analysis. An autoclave-type cell enables both XAFS and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) measurements in such casesIt is important to note that slight fluctuations in pressure will produce serious deformations in the XAFS background, due to the high density of the liquid medium, which could in turn affect the analysis of the XAFS spectra (Fig.

Simultaneous Measurements of Catalyst with Various Methods:
XAFS gives information about local structures around the X-ray-absorbing atom.Usually, additional analyses with other techniques are conducted separately to study complimentary properties of the material. In such cases, due to the difference in conditions, including the shape of the reactor, the amount of sample, the gas flow rate, the temperature distribution, and so on, it is challenging to exactly reproduce the same reaction conditions with different instruments. Thus, obtaining a perfect time-resolved correspondence between multiple data sets requires much care. Simultaneous observations of the same sample under the same conditions with different spectroscopic methods are ideal and provide much useful information about catalysts, and in situ XAFS combined with XRD, UV, and IR spectroscopy has been reportedVarious electrochemical devices, including fuel cells and sensors, have also been investigated by XAFS

General Notes Regarding In Situ XAFS:
As synchrotron radiation facilities have progressed, the available X-ray beam intensities have increased, and photon flux values much greater than 10 10 cm À2 s À1 are available. Although such high-brilliance sources are necessary for high-quality time-and space-resolved XAFS measurements, their use also requires special care to prevent damage to the X-ray windows and the sample. FigureAn important point regarding the Debye-Waller factor in in situ EXAFS analysis should also be considered. Under reaction conditions, high temperature may increase the Debye-Waller factors due to increasing levels of thermal disorder (Fig.

Time-Resolved XAFS:
XAFS has the potential to elucidate the mechanisms of dynamic processes such as chemical reactions or phase transitions of materials, since XAFS spectra can be obtained from any material without long-range order in any environment, as noted in Sect. 6.2. To observe such dynamic processes, the XAFS spectrum should be obtained within a time span of several seconds or preferably milliseconds or shorter. However, a conventional XAFS system working in the step-scan mode cannot acquire an entire XAFS spectrum within such short timescales because the monochromator must stop at each discrete energy value to measure the signal. The energy range of an XAFS spectrum is usually more than 1000 eV, and thus several tens of minutes are required to acquire an XAFS spectrum. FigureIn the 1980s, the recovery of bonds between carbon monoxide (CO) and myogloobin (Mb) was observed by pump-probe XAFSAlthough transient XAFS measurements are a powerful tool for the observation and determination of short-lived species, practical experimentation is very challenging, since very long data acquisition times are needed to obtain XAFS spectra with good S/N ratios. Recently, drastic advances in transient XAFS methodology have been achieved in Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory

PTRF-XAFS: Application of XAFS to Single-Crystal Model Surfaces:
XAFS is a powerful technique capable of providing information about the local structure around an X-ray-absorbing atom with sub-A ˚resolution. The application of XAFS to metal species dispersed on an oxide single-crystal surface, which can be regarded as a good model of an actual oxide-supported metal catalyst, should provide helpful information about the structures of the metal species and metal-support interactions. In this section, polarization-dependent total reflection fluorescence (PTRF)-XAFS technique for determining 3D structure of metal species deposited on a single-crystal surface is described.

Basics of Polarization-Dependent Total Reflection Fluorescence (PTRF)-XAFS Technique:
The angular dependence of EXAFS oscillations is expressed as in Eqs.for L II and L III -edge absorption:The selection of the K-edge or L I -edge is more effective as a means of assessing the polarization dependence of the bond direction compared to the use of the L II -or L III -edge, as can be predicted based on the dependence of χ(k) on θ i . Various metal species have been studied in this manner on a TiO 2

Setup for PTRF-XAFS Measurements:
To achieve precise total reflection conditions, the sample is set on a 6-axis goniometer as shown in Figs. 11.27 and 11.28. When using ultra-high vacuum (UHV) PTRF-XAFS equipment

Application of PTRF-XAFS to Metal Species on Single-Crystal Surfaces:
The following sections review some of our group's work concerning metal species on single-crystal oxide surfaces as characterized by PTRF-XAFS. Metal Complexes on TiO 2The applicability of this premodification method was also extended to another metal. Following the premodification of the TiO 2 surface with o-or m-MBA compounds, atomically dispersed Au species were successfully obtained, even though Au normally aggregates to form 3D nanoclusters (see section "Three-Dimensional (3D) Nanoclusters on TiO 2 (110)") when it is evaporatedSmall Nanoclusters on TiO 2 (110) Goodman et al. have proposed that the Pd dimer is the most stable and also the smallest moiety that may be deposited on a TiO 2Two-Dimensional (2D) Nanoclusters on TiO 2

Metal Species on Other Single-Crystal Oxide Surfaces:
The PTRF-XAFS technique can also be applied to other single-crystal oxides such as SiO 2 , MgO, and Al  prepared by chemical vapor deposition of Co 2 (CO) 8

Concluding Remarks and Future PerspectiveThe above discussion shows that XAFS is a powerful tool for the characterization of NPs dispersed on oxide surfaces, which represent very important materials in catalytic processes. Conventional XAFS provides the local structure around the active sites. The beauty of XAFS is that it allows the assessment of a catalytic system under actual reaction conditions and can determine changes in catalyst structures with a time resolution ranging from milliseconds to seconds, using Quick XAFS. Dispersive XAFS can also be used to follow faster processes if the transmission mode is available. If the material changes are repeatable, we can also apply the pump-probe method and obtain picosecond time resolution. Simultaneous measurements using XAFS in conjunction with other methods can allow analysis of the reaction mechanisms of NP catalysts. Although greater X-ray intensity values may be required to produce statistically valid data in some cases, it is important to pay attention to sample damage, especially when the beam is focused on the sample. The PTRF-XAFS technique allows the determination of the 3D structures of highly dispersed metal species supported on single-crystal surfaces, together with an analysis of metal-support interfacial bonds. This technique thus provides insight into the structural chemistry and material functions, especially at catalyst surfaces. In the future, it would be beneficial to improve the time resolution of the PTRF-XAFS technique, since PTRF-XAFS usually requires acquisition times on the order of 10 h in order to obtain a good S/N ratio for each spectrum. Another drawback of PTRF-XAFS is its limited capability to assess liquid/solid interfaces since the liquid phase generates a large amount of scattering and deteriorates the S/N ratio. Recently, our group has developed a high-sensitivity polarization-dependent fluorescence XAFS method that works well even in the presence of a liquid phase, based on the use of a log spiral spectrometer for fluorescence signal detectionAlthough this review has not considered high-energy-resolution emission spectroscopy

Overview:
Successful implementation of industrial processes depends partly on understanding of systems in use conditions. Hence, for transformation of natural materials, a good knowledge of structure and behavior of these materials in process conditions is desirable. Among natural materials, few of them are nanostructured, and very few techniques are available to characterize these systems in thermodynamic and hydrodynamic conditions close to one encountered in the industrial process.Small-angle scattering (SAS) techniques, either X-ray or neutrons, has the potential, but its use is sometimes limited to manufactured or synthetic systems. Laboratory SAXS equipments become more popular but remain sparse, especially in industrial environment. Large-scale facilities such as synchrotron or neutron centers have been used for academic research but open now more and more to industrial issues. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the contribution of SAXS and SANS to the characterization of natural nano-materials.Two different nanostructured materials will be examined here. The first one comes from heavy cuts of petroleum where the largest and most aromatic molecules -the asphaltenes -self-associate. The behavior of such aggregates generally impairs processes. This aggregation behavior will be examined in the bulk as well as at liquid/liquid or liquid/solid interfaces. A special attention will be paid to observation close to use conditions. The second ones are geomaterials, including sedimentary rocks and gas and oil shales. For these materials, the pore size distribution (open versus closed porosity, accessibility of pores to various fluids) is of primary interest leading to a better understanding of gas storage and transport mechanisms and their controls.We will show, through the study of these two nanostructured materials, how SAS techniques contribute to the characterization of such systems.

Description of SAS Experiment:
A typical scattering experiment aims at measuring the scattering intensity produced by a sample illuminated by a monochromatic beam (λ) of X-ray or neutron (Fig.

Length Scale and Wave Vector:
For systems presenting periodic inhomogeneities, the scattering pattern will present a correlation peak. The Bragg law 2d sinθ = λ could be used to relate the period d of inhomogeneities to the observed scattering angle 2θ at peak maximum. By combining the Bragg law to Eq. 12.1, one finds:For a porous system, it was shownMore generally, q is related to the inverse of a characteristic length in direct space. It means that large particles or pores will scatter at small q values and conversely.The wave vector q is seen as an inverse length probe. The consequence is also that the multi-scale description of a structure requires acquiring data in a large q range. The usual q values accessible by SAXS or SANS instruments are in the range 5 10 À3 -0.5 A ˚À1 . This range could be extended with USAXS and USANS down to

Beam/Matter Interaction and Atomic Scattering Length:
It is well known that X-ray interacts with electrons, whereas neutrons interact with nucleus. Atoms are often considered as individual scatterers, and atomic scattering length is used to quantify the magnitude of the interaction. For X-rays, the atomic scattering length b is simply the product of atomic number Z by the scattering length b e of one electron (b e = 2.81 10 À13 cm). For neutrons, there are no simple rules and tabulated

Coarse Graining: Scattering Length Densities, Contrast:
Scattering Length Density As mentioned previously, small-angle scattering is sensitive to fluctuation down to the nanometer length scale. Nevertheless, this scale is almost one order of magnitude larger than the atomic scale, and atomic scattering length is usually averaged in order to simplify scattering intensity modeling. The way of averaging is to sum the atomic scattering length of each atom over a volume representative of a phase, a particle, or a region where the scattering properties of matter do not vary. We use for that scattering length densities (SLDs or noted ρ):where n i is the number of atoms of type i in the volume V. This volume could be the unit cell for a crystal or the molecular volume for liquid or amorphous solid. Note that the calculation of SLD requires at least the knowledge of composition and mass density. Using this definition, no fluctuation occurs if a simple liquid is considered and the resulting intensity should be null. Experiments confirm almost this point: a small scattering intensity is in fact observed. This small signal, ascribed to isothermal compressibility of the liquid, shows no or little q-dependence. . From these values, the X-ray contrast Δρ = (SLD SiO2 À SLD H2O ) = 13 10 10 cm À2 could be defined. The more important the contrast is, the more important the intensity is. Due to very different neutron scattering lengths of H and D (Table

Contrast:
This important property is extensively used in SANS where neutron SLD of usual solvents (water, toluene, heptane, etc.) could be adjusted at any desired value, while chemical properties are fixed, between the one of hydrogenated and deuterated solvent by mixing them. This practice, known as contrast variation, allows to:1. Measure the SLD of unknown homogeneous species. 2. Simplify the data interpretation in the case of complex multiple component systems that present several regions of different SLDs. In this case, several experiments where different mixtures of specific isotopic solvents match the different regions of particles or aggregates are necessary.

Scattering Intensity Modeling:
In the following part, expressions of the differential scattering cross section per unit volume (dΣ/dΩ (q) noted hereafter I(q)) will be given. The "Data Treatment" section will explicit how to relate measurements, i.e., number of photons or neutrons scattered, to I(q).

General Expressions:
The scattering amplitude A(q) by a volume V where isotropic SLD fluctuations ρ(r) occur is given by:Variations in SLD ρ(r) can be rewritten as the sum of an average SLD <ρ> and a fluctuation part δρ(r) around the mean value, the average term <ρ> giving no contribution to amplitude:The detector measures an intensity which is the square of the amplitude. Scattered intensity per unit volume I(q) is given by:In a case of a two-phase system, one of SLD ρ p and the second of SLD ρ s , Eq. 12.8 becomes:where v is the volume of the scatterer. For a dilute regime of N p scatterers in the volume V, the scattering intensity collected by the detector is the sum of scattering intensity coming from all the individual scatterers (particles, pores, etc.), and Eq. 12.9 can be rewritten as:Àiqr dr (12:10) By using notation where volume fraction ϕ (ϕ = N p v/V = nv) and form factor P(q) of scatterers appear, Eq. 12.11 relates the main contributions to scattering in dilute systems:The contrast term Δρ being squared in this expression, we note the importance of its accurate knowledge for intensity modeling. P(q), sometimes noted F 2 (q), is called the scatterer form factor and describes its geometry (size, shape, etc.). Note that for q = 0, P(q) = 1.For heterogeneous particles in a solvent (SLD ρ 0 ) such as core-shell particles, Eq. 12.11 has to be modified in order to account for SLD and volume of the core and shell, respectively, noted ρ C , ρ S , v(R), and v (ΔR):Equations 12.10, 12.11, 12.12, and 12.13 that are related to scattering by an assembly of isotropic, identical, and dilute scatterers could be developed according to the various q regimes considered.

Guinier Region:
In the so-called Guinier region (at scales larger than the typical size of particles or, equivalently, at q values smaller than the reverse size of particles), the Zimm approximation

!:
, for qR g < 1 (12:13)The validity of Eq. 12.13 can be extended for swollen particles. For polymers, BurchardFrom Eq. 12.11, I(0) takes a simple form for dilute solutions from which the scatterer volume v can be extracted:The "molar mass" M can be derived by using the usual expression:with d the specific gravity of the solute and N a the Avogadro number. Combining Eqs. 12.13, 12.14, and 12.15 and considering concentration c in grams per unit volume, one obtains:It is worth noting that expressions 12.14, 12.15, 12.16, and 12.17 are model independent.

Porod Domain:
At large q values, in the q-regime where q À1 become smaller than the curvatures of the interfaces, they appear flat and the scattering intensity is proportional to the total surface area Σ independently of the shape of the two phases. Hence, for sharp interfaces (in the normal direction but smooth in any other directions), Porodwhere Σ is surface per unit volume developed by the interface, i.e., the specific area expressed in m 2 /m 3 . For a dispersion of spheres of radius R at volume fraction ϕ, the size of the sphere can be deduced from surface area measurement using:In the case of rough interfaces that could be described by surface fractal formalism, the scattering intensity follows at large q values a power law dependence. The power law exponent is then À (6 À D s ) where D s is the surface fractal dimension (2 < D s < 3). The surface area Σ is related in this case to the measurement probe size r by:The pre-factor Σ X can be determined from SAS experiments in the high q limit [10]:

Intermediate Domain:
In the intermediate domain, the q variations of scattering intensity are ascribed to form factor of individual scatterers. Analytic expressions of simple geometric and homogeneous objects are availablewhereas for disorientated cylinders (radius R and height 2 L):• For L/R ( 1 and q > π/R, cylinders reduce to disks and the form factor decreases as q À2 . More generally, 2D objects such as lamellae or prolate ellipsoids behave the same. • For R/L ( 1 and q > 1/L, cylinders reduce to 1D objects and scattering intensity decreases as q À1 .

Intensity Modeling in the Whole q Range:
The direct method assumes a shape (i.e., a scatterer form factor) and calculates the analytical expression of scattering intensity I calc. (q) which is compared to experimental data I exp. (q) in order to minimize the χ 2 :for this modulation, the structure factor S(q) is introduced in the general expression of the scattering intensity:S(q) is related to the pair correlation function g(r) that describes the local order of scatterers, i.e., the probability to find a scatterer at a given distance of another one. g(r) depends on interaction potential V(r):And S(q) is related to g(r) by:From this expression, it appears that S(q) is an oscillatory function that tends to be 1 for large q values and for dilute systems.

Structure Factor:
Few structure factors are available in analytical form. Among them, the fractal structure factor will be used here. A mass fractal aggregate made of subunit (or primary particles) shows a self-similar structure between the size r 0 of primary particles and the size ξ of the aggregate. In this interval, the mass in sphere of radius r follows a power law M r ð Þ / r D where D is defined as the fractal dimension. In the same way, the density at distance r from mass center scales as r DÀ3 . The corresponding scattering intensity shows a q ÀD behavior in the 1/ ξ -1/r 0 q range (Fig.One of the useful expressions of fractal structure factor has been proposed by TeixeiraIn this expression, Γ is the gamma function, D is the fractal dimension of aggregates, and ξ is a characteristic distance above which the mass distribution is no longer described by the fractal law. ξ is related to the generalized radius of gyration Rg by

Zimm Approach:
For moderate concentration c of particles, interparticle interactions have to be taken into account, and the previous equations are modified through a virial expansion to give:This equation can be simplified in the Guinier region to yield:where A 2 is the second virial coefficient. Positive values of A 2 , significant of repulsive interaction between objects, lead to a lowering of the I(q)/ϕ ratio at small q values as the concentration increases. This relation holds up to concentrations where interactions are described by pair interactions. The left-hand part of Eq. 12.32 can be used to define an "apparent" mass M app which tends toward the real one at low concentration.

Instrumentation:
SAS experiments require a specific instrumentation, and this section is not devoted to such a detailed description. Useful reviews are given for neutrons by Grillo

Sample Thickness:
The choice of sample thickness x has to fulfill several requirements.• First of all, the counting time to get enough statistics on detector is closely related to sample thickness. The number of photons N(q) recorded per unit time depends on: 1. Number of scatterers in the beam, i.e., on optical path x (N(q) ~x) 2. Sample transmission T = e Àμx where μ is the linear absorption coefficient (N(q) ~eÀμx ) The counting time optimization requires to maximize the product x e Àμx . This condition is fulfilled for x = 1/μ or equivalently T = 1/e % 0.36. Hence for SAXS, if aqueous solutions are considered, the optimal sample thickness is close to 1 mm, whereas it is roughly 2 mm for hydrocarbons.• For SANS, the incoherent scattering has to be taken into account, and the rule of thumb is x = 1 mm for water and 2 mm for deuterated solvent. In any case, the transmission should be higher than 0.5. • Finally, sample thickness has to be such that multiple scattering is absent. A practical way to avoid multiple scattering is to decrease thickness up to the point where the ratio N(q)/x is constant. Multiple scattering is favored by large-size scatterers and high contrasts. A classical example is powders where large grains have large SLD compared to air. In this case, grains could be sprinkled on a scotch tape; in spite of ill defined thickness, data reduction for such powders is well documented

Sample Environment:
One of the major benefits of SAS technique is the fact that sample preparation is reduced. The various forms of samples such as liquids, solids, smokes, suspensions, gels, and foams to be analyzed make SAS one of the most versatile techniques. Moreover, sample could be solicited during measurements. Control of thermodynamic conditions (temperature, pressure, relative humidity, etc.) as well as hydrodynamic conditions (flow, stretching, shear rate, etc.) is common.

Measurements: Data Treatment:
Before starting an experiment, it is crucial to determine the required q range. It depends on the largest size of scatterer (observation in direct space could help). Experimentally, the q range could be varied by changing the detector-to-sample distance. If a large q range is needed, several acquisitions at different detector-tosample distances (configuration) could be necessary. After data treatment, measurements from different configurations are merged, and superposition of absolute intensities in the recovery q ranges is a good indication of data treatment quality.A rigorous data treatment is essential to convert number of photons or neutrons detected N(q) into experimental differential scattering cross section per unit volume I exp (q) that can be compared to calculated intensity I calc (q). The usual steps of data treatment of 2D raw images are the following:1. Centering and q calibration. For that, a measurement of a sample giving Bragg peak at low angle (e.g., Ag behenate for X-ray) is often convenient. A geometrical measurement of sample-to-detector distance is also an alternative. 2. Normalization of cell efficiency could be necessary. In that case, a measurement of a sample giving a flat scattering (water for neutrons) is convenient. If a region of the detector is faulty (cells behind the beam stop or its support), it could be also masked. 3. Subtraction of detector noise. 4. Normalization by the solid angle of a cell. 5. Normalization by sample transmission. Counting time for transmission must be such that transmission is known at a precision of few per thousand. 6. Radial averaging in case of isotropic scattering. 7. Subtraction of empty container. For liquids, the container could be a capillary for X-ray, a quartz cell for neutrons, an empty beam for solid samples, or more generally an empty cell. 8. Subtraction of the solvent. The "solvent" to consider is the one where its empty container contribution has been subtracted. If solute is concentrate (volume fraction ϕ), the subtraction of the "solvent" has to be weighted by a factor (1 À ϕ). 9. Normalization by the incident flux. In practice, external standards of known absolute cross sections

SANS:
Neutron facilities are rather sparse, but SANS spectrometer is well represented within neutron centers. Most of the spectrometers are designed with a 2D detector whose position could be varied in order to cover the usual q range of SANS (few 10 À3 -0.5 A ˚À1 ). Recently USANS instruments have been built in order to extend the q range down to 10 À4The most common windows used for SANS experiments are made of quartz since they give high transmission and low level of scattering. The beam size depends on collimation conditions and is generally of few millimeters. The fluxes are rather modest (few 10 6 neutrons/s on sample) compared to SAXS synchrotron. The benefit is the preservation of the sample integrity, whereas the drawback is the long counting time -up to hours -for low contrasted systems. One feature of neutron is the ease to vary wavelength by changing the rotating velocity of wavelength selector. According to Eq. 12.1, the q domain may be changed in this way.One of the major differences between the two techniques is the presence for neutrons of incoherent scattering that is notably important for 1 H. This incoherent scattering doesn't wear any structural information. It occurs in all the directions and gives rise to flat background. The solute and the solvent incoherent contribution have to be taken into account in data treatment

SAXS:
Unlike SANS, SAXS equipments are found both in laboratory and on synchrotrons. For both equipments, samples are held in containers whose windows are often made of quartz (quartz capillaries), mica, or thin films of polymers such as polyimide (Kapton).

Laboratory Setup:
Up to the 1980s, laboratory setup was frequently homemade equipments, and nowadays very good commercial equipments are available. The X-ray source (most of the time, λ = CuKα = 1.54 A ˚) is either a sealed tube or a rotating anode microsource delivering on sample fluxes between 10 6 and few 10 7 photons/ s in a submillimetric beam size. Few homemade laboratory setups have been designed in the USAXS domain

Synchrotron:
A lot of SAXS beamlines are now available on synchrotron. Compared to laboratory setups, the high fluxes (up to 10 14 photons/mm 2

Conclusion:
To conclude, a variety of equipments are now available. As a function of size heterogeneities, contrasts, available volume of sample, equilibrium, or dynamics, one can use at its best SAS or USAS techniques, X-ray or neutrons, laboratory setup, or synchrotron.

Key Research Finding:
SAS experiments have been intensely used in Soft Matter and Material Science to characterize manufactured or synthetic systems of interest. The present chapter aims at showing that such powerful techniques could also be used to gain insight into natural nano-materials structure in spite of their size and composition complexity. Most of the examples shown here come from petroleum or new energy industries. It will be shown that knowledge of mesoscopic structure of natural systems is of paramount importance in respect to many industrial processes. The demarche proposed here could be easily extended to other systems relevant to other industries.

Solution of Asphaltene:
Among natural nano-materials found in the petroleum industry, petroleum itself constitutes a natural colloidal system. In fact, petroleum is constituted of more than tens of thousandsIn parallel, the first separation that occurs in a refinery plant is the distillation that separates molecules as a function of their ebullition points. It has been shown that asphaltene belongs to the less volatile fraction.Asphaltenes represent a solubility class of industrial importance since they are known to increase the viscosities of crude oils, to phase separate from oil when they are mixed to low-polarity hydrocarbon fractions, or to be refractive to hydroconversion. All these macroscopic properties are thought to be related to their ability to form aggregates in crude oils. In this section, we will show how use of SAS methods improves the knowledge of aggregation behavior of asphaltene that could be relevant to better understand their macroscopic properties.

Molecular Aspects:
Chemical composition of asphaltene fraction has been measured using elemental analysisMolecular structure is always a subject of debate. The archipelago model where few small aromatic regions (2-3 cycles) are linked by alkyl chains is opposed to the continental model where one larger aromatic domain (5-10 cycles) is surrounded by alkyl peripheral chains.Several molecular interactions (π-π, H bonds, etc.)

Aggregated Material and Operational Definition of Asphaltene:
One of the first observations of asphaltenic crude oil using SAS was by DwigginsSeveral researchersA contribution to this question is found inIn parallel, separation of asphaltene and maltene from precipitation using either pentane C5 or heptane C7 anti-solvents has been performed, leading to four fractions, namely, maltene (MC5 and MC7) and asphaltene (AC5 and AC7). The composition and mass density of these fractions have been also determined.The combination of Eqs. 12.4 and 12.5 allows estimating the SLD of the different fractions. The results are plotted as a function of either AC5 or AC7 content (Fig.Fig.FigureThe main conclusions of this study could be summed up as follows:• In crude oil, there are aggregate polydisperses that are at nm length scale.• Based on the usual operational definition of asphaltenes, C5 asp. best represents the aggregated material in crude oils (id. maltene). • The precipitation and redispersion in simple solvent approach seem to be valid and allow more detailed characterization. • High temperature tends to disaggregate asphaltene but a structure at small length scale persists up to 300 C. • The M W vs. R g dependence for the largest aggregates suggests an aggregation mechanism leading to solvated aggregates.

Transient or Permanent Aggregation?:
In opposition to the colloidal approach commonly applied to asphaltenesTo discriminate between these two viewpoints and to gain insight into dynamic properties of asphaltene aggregates, we developed a methodologySamples are made of asphaltenes in toluene. A 3 wt% solution of asphaltenes in toluene was prepared, and two separations by ultracentrifugation were performed at 20 C. The first centrifugation allowed to recover six fractions of the supernatant: F1 (top) down to F6 (bottom). The pellet of this preparation was not considered in this study. The second centrifugation allowed recovering the pellet which was hardly dissolved in deuterated toluene to generate the F7 fraction. Each of the seven fractions was characterized by (1) asphaltene concentration by weighting an aliquot before and after solvent evaporation, (2) chemical composition (CHONS), (3) asphaltene mass density at 20 C as described elsewhereSAXS measurements of asphaltene fractions were processed at 23 C on an in-house experimental setup as described elsewhereFrom time-dependent intensity fluctuations, the normalized autocorrelation function of the scattered intensity G 2 (q,t) (e.g., a correlogram) is built. G 2 (q,t) is related to the modulus of the normalized field autocorrelation function g 1 (q,t) by Siegert relationship:where α is a baseline and β is the coherence factor. The time dependence of g 1 (q,t) is related to the dynamic properties of the solution. For Brownian, monodisperse, and noninteracting particles, g 1 (q,t) is an exponential decaying function:where Γ is the decay rate. For a polydisperse system, g 1 (q, t) can be decomposed into a sum of exponential decaying functions:where A i represents the scattered intensity contribution of particles of class i and Γ i its decay rate. To choose the number of characteristic decay times, we used a method based on Pade ´approximant. From this sum of exponential decaying functions, a standard Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to adjust the weight of each exponential decaying function. Good agreement between the data and the fit is reached when residual minimizing the Chi-square criterion is statistically distributed around zero without variations larger than a third the noise envelope. When the diffusion process is Brownian, the self-diffusion coefficient of the particles (D i ) is related to Γ i by:(12:36)In the high dilution limit, the self-diffusion coefficient D i enables calculation of the hydrodynamic radius R Hi of the hard-sphere-equivalent noninteracting particles using the Stokes-Einstein equation:where k B and η are, respectively, the Boltzmann constant and the solvent viscosity. Scattering intensities obtained from SAXS and SANS measurements are shown in Fig.• The small q regions allowed fitting data to the Zimm approximation (Eqs. 12.13, 12.14, 12.15, 12.16, and 12.17) as shown in Fig.• The large q region (q > 1 nm À1 ) behaves the same for all fractions, suggesting that the structure at small length scale is independent of the size of the aggregates. The fractal concept suggests that aggregates are made of primary particles. It seems that the form factor of these primary particles is seen in this q region.From DLS measurements, autocorrelation functions (not shown here) have been obtained. It was observed that baseline α (Eq. 12.33) was much higher for small aggregates (fractions F1 and F2) due to increasing contribution of fluorescence relatively to scattering intensity. For few samples, additional measurements on equipment allowing DLS measurements at 2θ = 135 have been realized. For these samples, the decay rates scale linearly with q 2 (Eq. 12.36). This observation and the fact that autocorrelation functions have been measured demonstrate that asphaltene forms permanent aggregates at least at time scale of experiments. From decay rates, mean hydrodynamic radii R H have been estimated using Eq. 12.37. Their comparison to radii of gyration R G (Fig.This study based on scattering measurements has demonstrated:1. The nanometric and large-size polydispersity of asphaltene aggregates in toluene solutions 2. The permanent character of aggregation in asphaltene-based systems 3. The mass fractal character of aggregates and, as a result, the existence of primary asphaltene particles 4.1.4 Structure of Large-Scale Aggregates and Their Implication on Solution Viscosities One of the most important industrial issues in asphaltenic crude oils or residues is the huge viscosity ascribed to the asphaltene fraction that impairs their transport properties. The scientific question that arises is then to establish the relationship between mesoscale structure of aggregates and viscosity of the corresponding solutions.We have usedThe viscosity and the structure of these asphaltene fraction solutions have been investigated using, respectively, rheological and X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements as a function of concentration.The viscosities η reported are the zero shear rate viscosities determined in the first Newtonian domain of asphaltene solutions using a Contraves LS30 viscometer at 25 C. From viscosity measurements, relative viscosities η r , i.e., the ratio of solution-to-solvent η 0 viscosity, are formed and plotted as a function of asphaltene volume fraction ϕ (Fig.To obtain the k and [η] parameters, Eq. 12.38 can be rearranged to yield:where η red and η spe are, respectively, the reduced and specific viscosities. For a system of spheres without interactions, the [η] value is 2.5. EquationFor solvated particles or aggregates, the hydrodynamic "swollen" volume fraction ϕ eff , often called "effective" volume fraction, is different from the "dry" solute volume fraction ϕ. The ratio of these quantities defines solvation constant k S :where n is the number of aggregates per unit volume, v eff is the hydrodynamic volume of a solvated aggregate (solute plus solvent trapped in the aggregate), and v is the volume of a "dry" aggregate (solute only). If a spherical shape of aggregates is assumed, the ratio of their intrinsic viscosity to the one of hard spheres is again the k s value [η]/2.5 = k s . By combining the latter equation with Eq. 12.40, we obtain Eq. 12.41 which provides a practical way to renormalize concentration:This renormalization is particularly useful to compare the present system to the one of hard spheres that has been studied in detail. Hence, for more concentrated hardsphere systems, Eq. 12.38 is no more appropriate. Instead, semiempirical models have been developed: they predict the viscosity divergence when the particle volume fraction approaches the dense random packing limit fraction ϕ m . The Quemada equation, based on dissipated energy minimization by viscous effects, is frequently used because of its simplicity:   Polydispersity can also have a significant effect on viscosity in the concentrated regime: the maximum packing fraction ϕ m increases from about 0.63 for the monodisperse case up to values close to unity for large polydispersity systems (small spheres can fill the gap between the large ones in contact). Consequently, for a same volume fraction, a suspension of polydisperse spheres will exhibit a lower viscosity than the monodisperse one, especially at higher fractions (see Eq. 12.42). FigureIn parallel, SAXS measurements have been conducted on the same solutions using a homemade equipment that allowed exploring the 0.01-0.22 A ˚À1 q range. The ASP fraction series, normalized to their asphaltene content and contrast, is shown in Fig.The q À2.1 behavior, observed at large q values for each fraction, could be ascribed either to bidimensional or to mass fractal aggregates of fractal dimension 2.1. Viscosity measurements ruled out the assumption of flat aggregates. We will examine in the following the consistency and the robustness of mass fractal aggregate assumption. For such a system, at much smaller scale than the typical size of aggregates, a simple expression of the scattering cross section is expected:Furthermore, a power law relation among the measured aggregate parameters, namely, radius of gyration, second virial coefficient, and molar mass, should be observed for these aggregates:0.00 0.0 0.05 0.10 0.15 2.0x10 -51.5x10 -51.0x10 -5

5.0x10 -6:
A ;Finally, for such a system and by analogy with polymer solutions, the intrinsic viscosity should be related to the mass of aggregates by:, close to 2.1, is a very strong indication of the fractal nature of asphaltene aggregates. This polydispersion of solvated fractal aggregates has been confirmed by others

Asphaltene in Non-ambient Conditions:
For crude oil production, transport, or refining applications, temperature of interest is in the range of À20-400 C, whereas pressures are in the range of atmospheric up to 500 bars. Characterization at temperature and pressure process conditions is highly desirable. One of the main advantages of scattering techniques is the possibility to do measurements when applying a constraint to the sample. The following section will detail some studies on asphaltene aggregation in non-ambient conditions.In a first studyFor a given temperature, only minor effects of pressure on asphaltene aggregation are observed (Fig.Temperature effects have been recently studied on a vacuum residue diluted with its pentane maltene and using in-house SAXS experimentsSimilar trends have been obtained by others using either SAXSIt can be concluded that pressure has minor effects on asphaltene aggregation, whereas raising temperature disaggregates asphaltene to some extent, but small aggregates are still present at the highest probed temperatures (~300 C).

The Nano-aggregate Fine Structure:
Until now, only the Guinier region of SAS has been considered, and asphaltene aggregates have been described as mass fractal ones. This fractal aggregation implicitly assumes that the structure is self-similar between two characteristic sizes:• The one of the aggregates that is roughly their radius of gyration • The one of primary particles that scatter at large q values This chapter is dedicated to the structure of these primary particles. The main questions that arise concern their shape, their sizes, their composition, and their relation to the molecular level.For thatThe usual way to determine form factors of particles presenting different SLD regions is the contrast variation. Additional measurements of the same asphaltene in various mixtures of deuterated and hydrogenated toluene were performed on the PACE spectrometer of LLB. A special attention was paid to get high signal to noise ratio data at large q values and to subtract realistic incoherent scattering backgroundsThe general idea is to separate from I(q) measurements the structure factor S(q) and the form factor P(q). The structure factor chosen here is the one of fractal aggregates, and the analytical expression (Eq. 12.30) of TeixeiraRegarding our previous workwhere subscripts C, S, and 0 refer, respectively, to the core, the shell, and the solvent. R and ΔR are the radius of the core and the shell thickness, and V stands for the volume. Subscript α refers either to a sphere (Eq. 12.21) or to a cylinder (Eq. 12.22). The sphere and cylinder geometries fit equally SAXS data, but regarding neutrons, core-shell cylinder geometry gives relatively good fits for all solvent conditions, contrary to the core-shell sphere geometry. The dimensions of the cylinder geometry reveal that the particles are core-shell flat disks with a core radius of 18 A ˚rather monodisperse (σ = 0.3), a shell of 14.4 A ˚thickness, and a height of x.Np<P(q)²> (cm -1 )x.Np<P(q)²> (cm -1) q (Å -1 ) 10 -2 10 -1 q (Å -1 )Core-shell sphere Core-shell cylinder Fig.The SLD of the core and shell have been also determined for both X-ray and neutrons from intensity modeling. FigureComing back to the molecular level, it is clear that such a nano-aggregate is likely the result of island molecule aggregation through π-π interactions and that steric hindrance by peripheral chains will limit the extent of aggregation to few molecule layers. From the height of the disk (6.7 A ˚) and from the inter-aromatic plane distance of graphitic material (%3.3 A ˚), the aggregation number in the stacking direction is %3 in fully agreement with recent results by molecular simulation.

Hierarchical Aggregation:
From the previous sections, it was shown that SAS experiments are well-suited techniques to study the aggregation properties of asphaltene in the bulk that is summed up as:1. Asphaltene form permanent aggregates in crude oil and solvents. 2. This aggregation is hierarchical going from molecules to nano-aggregates which form clusters at larger length scales. 3. The fine structure of nano-aggregates has been specified as core-shell disks, the core being aromatic and the shell aliphatic. This fine structure is in line with the island molecular model. 4. The cluster structure determines the viscosity properties of asphaltene solutions. 5. Clusters dissociate at high temperature, whereas nano-aggregates do not.The contribution of SAS to the aggregation behavior knowledge appears central but still some questions remain as the arrangement of molecules inside the nanoaggregate core. Also few is known on the nature of molecular and aggregate interactions. Finally, all the conclusions have been drawn from asphaltenes of limited sources, and it will be interesting to extend the structural scheme to crude from various geochemical provenances.

Asphaltene at Interfaces:
If the aggregation behavior of asphaltene affects largely bulk properties of their parent crude oil, they are also known to accumulate at water and solid-crude interfaces influencing macroscopic properties such as emulsion stability or wettability.

Asphaltene at Liquid-Liquid Interfaces:
In shearing conditions, when water is contacted with crude oil, water in crude oil emulsion is formedIn a scattering-based emulsion studyFirstly, the longer the extracting alkane chains are, the higher the cluster size and mass are in the initial xylene solution. Secondly, the cluster size and mass are lower in supernatant than in initial solution suggesting that the most aggregated species are in the interfacial film. Lastly, the mass to radius of gyration dependence shows the same behavior than previously reported, reminiscent of mass fractal aggregates.To gain insight into interfacial film structure, we directly measured the droplet sediments and applied contrast variation techniques. Two limiting cases were considered:1. The case where SLD of mixture of heavy and light water is equal to the one of deuterated xylene (5.9 10 10 cm À2 ) and different from the SLD of asphaltene (1.4 10 10 cm À2 ). Then, the coherent intensity comes both from asphaltene aggregates in the oily phase (approximated by supernatant scattering) and from interfacial films. The subtraction of scattering intensity of supernatant to the one of settled droplets according to its volume fraction in the sedimented phase gives the  scattering contribution of the interfacial films. Such a procedure is illustrated in Fig.Plot of Ln(q 2 I(q)) versus q 2 presents a linear regime and from the slope, film thickness is estimated. 2. The case where SLD of mixture of hydrogenated and deuterated xylene is equal to the one of asphaltene and different from SLD of heavy water (6.4 10 10 cm À2 ). Then, scattering comes from water-oil interface and a Porod behavior is expected. Use of Eq. 12.17 allows estimating the surface area Σ of settled emulsion. If asphaltene concentrations are measured both in the supernatant and in the initial asphaltene in xylene solution, then surface excess Γ in mg/m 2 could be calculated.FigureIn conclusion, the contrast matching SANS method has proved to be a valuable and unique technique to investigate directly interfacial film properties from model emulsion systems. This film seems to form from the largest aggregates present in bulk. The water in oil asphaltene emulsion stability is related to film characteristics and parameters such as film thickness, and density seems to play a major role. In the future, this technique could be used to investigate other parameters such as the water content and aging.

Asphaltene at Liquid-Solid Interfaces:
The behavior of asphaltene at solid-liquid interface is of first importance regarding industrial processes. Indeed, crude oil-solid surface contact is ubiquitous in the petroleum industry going from crude oil generation in kerogen to nano-porous catalyst in hydroconversion units and passing through reservoirs, pipelines, surface facilities, or heat exchanger. This contact may cause variation in surface properties such as reservoir wettability alteration, deposition, and fouling of pipelines or equipments in contact with crude oils or retentionAsphaltene is known to be the fraction of crude oil that accumulates at solid interfaceAdsorption isotherms have been measuredIn parallel, the weight average molecular mass of asphaltene clusters M W and their radii of gyration R g have been determined from laboratory SAXS measurements using the Zimm approximation (Eqs. 12.13, 12.14, 12.15, 12.16, and 12.17). M W were found to vary from 44 to 270 kDa, whereas R g are in the 49-107 A ˚range. These two parameters were found to scale as: FigureUsing a simple geometrical model where all the available surfaces S are paved with aggregates without any further structural modifications, the relation between surface excess Γ pl and a monolayer of n individual aggregates of size R s and mass M w is simply: If we assume that no reorganization occurs during adsorption (R s = R g ), we can combine Eqs. 12.49 and 12.51. The result, Γ pl / M 0:1 w , is far from experimental measurement (Eq. 12.50) ruling out the assumption of no reorganization. Conversely, it could be shown that an exponent close to 0.37 requires a "fractal dimension" close to 3, i.e., a densification of cluster when adsorbed. FigureIn conclusion, the relevant species to be considered for asphaltene adsorption from stable crude oil is the cluster that tends to densify at solid contact.To go further in adsorption studies, we coupled adsorption isotherm measurements from either stable or aggregating asphaltene solution onto hydrophilic or hydrophobic silica particles to measurements at the nanometer length scale using neutron reflectivityFor good-solvent conditions such as xylene, adsorption isotherms reveal that whatever the nature of silica surface (hydrophilic or hydrophobic) is, the shape of isotherm does not vary and the same plateau adsorbed amount is observed. At local scale, neutron reflectivity on bare (hydrophilic) or grafted (hydrophobic) silica evidences in both cases a rather dense adsorbed layer (ϕ asphaltene % 0.6) whose thickness is comparable to the radius of gyration of asphaltene clusters in the bulk solution. Densification is in line with the previous studyWhen bad solvent is added, the structure of the asphaltene adsorbed profile exhibits a transition from a monolayer to a multilayer structure when crossing the bulk flocculation threshold transition. This is thus a nice illustration of the strong relationship existing between the structure and the dynamics of growth of the asphaltene aggregates in solution and the adsorbed profiles at the solid-liquid interface.In conclusion, neutron reflectivity could be an alternative technique to probe SLD profiles at liquid-solid interfaces.We took advantage of specular neutron reflectivity (SNR) geometry to investigate the influence of shear rate on multilayer growth kineticsFor a given shear rate, once bad solvent (deuterated dodecane) has been added to asphaltene in xylene solution, data were acquired as a function of time at a rate of one spectrum every 30 min. An example is given for a shear rate of 1200 s À1 (Fig.The multilayer growth kinetics at bad (dodecane) to good (xylene) solvent ratio of 66:34 has been followed using SNR for two different shear rates (1200 and 2400 s À1 ). The "neutron" surface excess has been estimated by integration over z of asphaltene concentration profiles. They are reported in Fig.First of all, we obtain a very good qualitative agreement between the two techniques, and it is clear from these data that shearing slows down the kinetics of multilayer growth. Second, after a quasi-linear behavior in the first times of adsorption, the curves tend to saturate for the long times suggesting that a stationary state could be reached. This equilibrium state could represent the balance between growth of layer by adsorption of new clusters coming from solution and desorption by the shear.In conclusion, SNR -a parent technique of SANS -appears as a well-suited technique to study in situ the influence of shear rate on kinetics of multilayer layer growth. The study confirms the shear-limited character of asphaltene deposition [65] and is useful for modeling clogging in porous media (reservoir or catalyst). The technique enables to get concentration profiles within the layer that could help to explain irreversibility of asphaltene adsorption.

Geomaterials:
Geomaterials represent another class of natural nano-material encountered in the petroleum industry. SAS techniques enable to characterize their nanoscale organization in order to get understanding of their use properties.

Clay-Based Systems:
One of the most studied geomaterials is the clay suspension. They are used as drilling fluid in the petroleum industry. They give rise to interesting behavior and are found in the form of sols, gels, glasses, and even liquid crystals. SAS has been intensely used to study their phase diagram as a function of concentration and ionic strength. A recent review by Bailey

Sedimentary Rocks:
Sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, argillite, or carbonates are composed on the one hand of various minerals whose crystallite size varies in the 1-100 μm range and on the other of pores in the same size range. Porous sedimentary rocks are the most common reservoirs for oil and gas deposits. Knowledge of pore size distribution, fluid localization, fluid-mineral surface interactions, and flow within the porous medium is often of paramount importance for petrophysics properties involved in oil recovery methods. At first sight, the multicomponent character of sedimentary rocks is not in line with the usual two-phase systems required to SAS data modeling. In the same way, the typical pore or crystallite sizes are not in the same size range as the inhomogeneities probed by SAS methods in the usual q range. Nevertheless, scattering methods have been applied to the sedimentary rock characterization

Two-Phase System?:
The fist point to consider is whether the minerals could be considered as a two-phase system (mineral and pores) regarding their scattering properties. For that, ClarksonIt is clear from this table that SLDs are not constant. Nevertheless, for most of minerals, an SLD value close to ~3.8 10 10 cm À2 could be considered. From Eq. 12.52, a generalization of Eq. 12.5:1. Mean SLD value <ρ> can be estimated provided the volume fraction of each constituent is known. XRD analysis, including Rietveld refinement, could be used for that purposeThis point is illustrated in Fig.

Nanoscale?:
The second point to consider is the length scale of SAS measurements (1-1000 nm) compared to pore size (1-100 μm) usually found in sedimentary rocks. It is clear that from SAS measurements, the asymptotic Porod domain will be mainly probed. From the general expression of scattering intensity (Eqs. 12.19 and 12.20) in the high q limit, SAS will give information on the roughness of mineral-air interface and on the corresponding surface area.In practice, most of the investigated systems present rough interfaces giving power law q dependence with exponents Àα (α = 6 À Ds) larger than À4. For instance, "Vosges" sandstoneIn these neutron or X-ray experiments, both the high values of scattering contrast, pore volume, and the pore volume fraction give for a neutron or a photon a very high probability to scatter. In these conditions, a special attention has to be paid to avoid multiple scattering. A parametric study by Radlinski et al.Pfeifer and AvnirIn practice, the distribution in Eq. 12.53 is both upper and lower bound, i.e., extends only in the range r min < r < r max . The upper and lower bound in pore space are related to lower and upper limit in q space where the q À(6ÀDs) behavior is observed.In order to capture the entire pore size distribution, scattering intensity measurements are often extended down to very low q values using USANS or USAXS. For uncorrelated and spherical pores, the scattering intensity is related to the pore size distribution by

Localization of Fluids Within Porous Media:
We took advantage of the well-defined surface fractal "Vosges" sandstone to investigate the localization of water -considered as a wetting fluid -within the poresThe dry, as well as water saturated, "Vosges" sandstone SANS spectra are shown in Fig.q (Å -1 ) I (q) (a.u.) q* = 0.017 Å -1Vosges Sandstone the porous medium at small length scales as illustrated in Fig.

Oil and Gas Shales:
Oil shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock containing a solid mixture of organic compounds called kerogen. Pyrolysis of kerogen produces shale oil and ultimately shale gas. Recently, oil shales gained attention as potential abundant resource of oil and gas. From our perspective, they could be distinguished from usual sedimentary rocks by their inherent kerogen content and their broad pore size distribution (PSD) including nano-pores located in kerogen and meso-pores generated by small particle (mainly clays) compaction. Understanding the nature of the pore structure (PSD and open versus closed porosity) is a primary objective leading to a better understanding of gas storage and transport mechanisms and their controls. Recent advance in the detailed mesoscale organization of such a complex material benefits from application of SAS methods.SANS measurements of kerogen of various geochemical types as well as of various thermal maturities were performed in order to estimate SLD of this materialA good agreement between the two methods is found. Furthermore, ρ K was found to vary almost linearly from 4 to 1 10 10 cm À2 when H/C ratio varies from 0.5 to 1.4. A value of 4 10 10 cm À2 is similar to the one of minerals (TableDirect USANS-SANS measurements on oil shales were performed in 2000 by Radlinski et al.Recently, Ruppert et al.It was shown that only 85 % of the pores were filled by water whatever their sizes. For methane, 85 % of the pores in the 10 μm-30 nm size range are filled, whereas it falls to ~60 % when pore sizes smaller than 30 nm are considered. Another study by BahadurLee et al.From these recent contributions to oil shale characterization, it appears that SAS and USAS methods are perfectly adapted to the pore size found in these materials. Furthermore, the ability to control the sample environment allowed studying the affinity of various fluids to pores in the mineral or kerogen network. The possibility to vary contrast in SANS experiments is notably useful.

Conclusions and Future Perspectives SAS techniques have been presented through characterization of various natural nano-materials. It appears that different instruments (SAS or USAS) could be used to probe materials at different length scales varying from 1 nm up to 10 μm.SAXS and SANS differ by contrast considerations, beam size, and flux on the samples. Each technique could be used separately for its own advantage, but they can also be used together for their complementarity. The structure resolution of nano-aggregate of asphaltene constitutes a good example of such an association.Two very different nano-materials have been discussed, and it was shown that SAS technique proved to be very well suited to the characterization of such heterogeneous systems. Nevertheless, separation techniques such as centrifugation, filtration, etc. are often required to simplify polydisperse systems. Again, the joint use of X-ray and neutron, as well as the possibility to vary contrast in SANS, constitutes a serious advantage for these complex natural nano-materials.The reduced preparation of samples as well as their solicitation during observation is clearly an advantage. Examples such as high-temperature (300 C) measurements of a vacuum residue, shear control of asphaltene solution during deposition, or simply humidity control in sandstone prove the demarche to be well founded.Examination by these techniques of new nano-materials of industrial importance such as lingo-cellulosic biomass constitutes an exciting perspective. Introduction So far, many good books regarding experimental techniques and structural analysis by small-angle scattering have been publishedThough both SANS and SAXS have played an important role in probing structures of nanomaterials, each of the SAXS and SANS techniques has unique characteristics. The X-ray scattering is caused mainly by interactions of the incident beam with electrons, while the neutron scattering is done by those of the incident beam with nucleusCharacteristics of synchrotron SAXS and SANS are compared in the following.Synchrotron X-Rays (i) Heavier atoms have larger scattering length.(ii) The beam size is usually very small due to high photon fluxes (typically submillimeter), which enables us to obtain precise data with a very small amount of samples. (iii) Energetic and angular resolutions are high.

Neutrons:
(i) Spatial information on light atoms such as hydrogen can be evaluated.(ii) Larger beam size in comparison with synchrotron X-rays is used (typically 5-10 mm). (iii) Information on magnetic structures of condensed matter can be obtained from the magnetic scattering. (iv) Contrast variation and contrast-matching techniques are very effective to probe the structure of complicated systems. Especially, in aqueous solutions and/or hydrogels, we can easily change scattering contrast by preparing H 2 O/D 2 O with different mixing ratios.In the past two decades, high-performance materials have attracted material scientist's interest due to the potential applications in various fields. In many cases, functionality of materials is closely related to the internal structure. With the high performance of materials, the system has grown more complex, and therefore, it is important to clarify the structure of the complicated system in the modern material science. We will show that combination of various scattering methods and contrast variation methods are useful to analyze structures of the complicated systems. This book chapter deals with structural studies of complex soft materials such as polymeric systems, self-assembling systems, composite systems, etc. using X-ray and neutron scattering. Constitution of this book chapter is as follows: Sect. 4 briefly describes a fundamental of scattering methods. In Sects. 5.1 and 5.2, we briefly present an overview of scattering behaviors of hierarchically organized structures on each level. These are common to both of X-ray and neutron scattering. In Sect. 5.3, recent structural studies of soft materials using contrast variation SAXS and SANS are reviewed. Although the contrast variation method has been utilized from old times, recently, it largely has displayed the power against structural analysis of various complex materials. In Sects. 5.4 and 5.5, we introduce structural evolution using time-resolved scattering measurements and complementary use of X-ray scattering and neutron scattering. Complimentary use of neutron and X-ray scattering may be effective in the structural studies of various complex materials

Experimental and Instrumental Methodology:
We show a schematic representation of typical small-angle scattering experiments in Fig.and therefore, the phase difference ϕ k is described bywhere k i and k s are wavevectors of incident ray and scattered ray and the magnitudes areThe scattering data are analyzed with scattering vector q defined by q = k i -k s . The magnitude of the scattering vector is expressed bywhere θ and λ represent the scattering angle and wavelength, respectively. The amplitude of the scattered wave at point K can be described bywhere A 0 is the amplitude of the incident wave and b is the scattering length. We can generalize Eq. (13.4) for the system composed of many identical scatterers, i.e., the total contribution A t is described as follows:Thus, the scattering amplitude F(q) is defined byand the scattering intensity is presented byWhen the scatterers are continuously distributed in a sample, F(q) can be replaced by the following integral form:n(r) is the local density of the scatterer at a point r. The relationship between the length scale of a structure in real space Λ and q is presented in the following form:The data collection, data reduction, and data correction in SAXS experiments were recently written in details by a review article of Pauw

Key Research Findings:
In the following sections, we will review recent structural studies of soft materials investigated by combination of various scattering methods and by using a sophisticated analysis such as contrast variation SANS and SAXS methods and will show scattering functions from particles with various structural morphologies. Here although we introduce structural studies on polymer-nanoparticle composite gel, polymer micelles, and organogel comprising low molecular weight organogelator (LMOG), the analysis can be applied to other similar systems.

Hierarchical Structures of Various Soft Materials:
Recently, facilities of synchrotron radiation and neutron sources around the world are remarkably developing. Combination of various scattering methods allows us to obtain structural information in a broad q range. Nowadays, simultaneous SAXS and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) measurements can be performed in many synchrotron beamlines over the worldAs mentioned above, combining various scattering techniques makes it possible to obtain structural information of a broad length scale ranging from nanometers to micrometersHere let us show a scattering profile combined by various scattering methods for an organogel composed of a LMOG, which entraps various organic solvents by self-assembly of the gelator molecules at very low concentrationsA shoulder peak at q ~0.046 Å À1 originates from cross-sectional scattering of fibrillar aggregates. The peak position suggests that the organogel is composed of nanofibers with a cross section of the radius of 8 nm with a comparatively narrow size distribution

Structural Analysis of Soft Materials:
Analysis of scattering data obtained by combination of various scattering methods is important. Here we shall show theoretical scattering function on each level and the unified approach to small-angle scattering of the multilevel structures such as the Beaucage model

Spherical Particles:
The scattering intensity for spherical monodisperse particles can be written bywhere n p and V p 2 represent the number density of the particles and the square of the volume, respectively. Δρ is the scattering length density. P(q) and S(q) are the form factor of the particles and the structure factor. The former comes from the intraparticle interferences, while the latter comes from the interparticle interferences. In dilute systems the interactions between the particles can be ignored, and therefore, S(q) approaches unity.Series expansion of P(q) in a small q range (qR g <<1) leads to Guinier's law,where R g is the radius of gyration of a particle. Guinier's law is applicable to particulate systems with an arbitrary shape other than spherical particles. We can estimate R g from the plot of ln (I(q)) vs. q 2 for dilute systems. R g of objects with various shapes is summarized in TableIn the intermediate q range, P(q) depends upon the size and the shape of the particles. P(q) of spherical particles with radius R is presented by(13:12)Rectangular parallelepiped (sides 2a, 2b, 2c)Taking into consideration the size distribution of the radius, the scattering intensity is expressed bywhere N(R) represents the distribution function of the radius, and the lognormal distribution or the Gaussian distribution is often used.R 0 and σ are the geometric mean and the geometric standard deviation of the distribution, respectively.

Nonspherical Particles:
For nonspherical monodisperse systems, the scattering intensity can be written bywithHere the bracket in |hF(q)i| 2 is an average weighed by the distribution of particle sizes and orientations. S app (q) behaves as an apparent interparticle structure factor. In dilute systems, since S q ð Þ ¼ 1, S app q ð Þ ¼ 1. It is known that self-assembly of small molecules and macromolecules in soft materials often forms fibrillar aggregates with various cross-sectional shapes. In the following sections, form factors of fibrillar aggregates with various cross-sectional shapes are briefly summarized.

Form Factor of Cylindrical Particles:
Form factor P(q) of randomly oriented cylinders (rods) with radius R and length 2H,where β is the angle between the scattering vector q and the axis of the cylinder, and J 1 is the Bessel function of the first order. When the length of the fibrillar aggregates L is sufficiently long in comparison with the cross-sectional size, P(q) can be approximated by [2, 3]There is a relation of L = 2H. Here I c (q) represents the scattering intensity from cross section of cylindrical rod particles. In a q range much smaller than reciprocal of cross-sectional size but much larger than that of cylindrical rod length, i.e., for 2π= L << q << 2π=R c , I c (q) can be approximated by the Guinier type of representation,where R c and A are the radius of the gyration and the area of the cross section of rod particles, respectively. Equation (13.20) is valid for cross section of arbitrary geometric shape. We can estimate R c from slope in plot of ln(Iq) vs. q 2For particles with disk shape(13:21b)FigureFigureHere let us show scattering curves of fibrillar aggregates formed by self-assembly of a low molecular weight organogelator in an organic solvent. FigureThe SANS data can be well described with the cylindrical form factor with the lognormal distribution (Eqs.

Form Factor of Rod Particles with Rectangular Cross Section:
When the cross section has a rectangular Shape of the lengths of the sides a and b, I c (q) is presented by

Form Factor of Long Helices:
Cross section of fibrillar aggregates has a variety of shapes such as hollow tube, helical ribbon, and double tube superhelix other than circular and rectangular cross sectionsn q dr (13:23b) J n (x) is the Bessel function of the first kind and order of n. L and P are the total length of the helix with its outer radius R and its inner radius aR and the helix period, respectively. The parameters φ and ω are the angle between the two sectors of a double helix and the angular part of the sector of a material, respectively. Although the summation in Eq. (13.23a) is described as infinite series, as a matter of fact, the terms for n ! qR/b, i.e., n ! Pq/2π, are zero. The model can be extended to a helical tape consisted of N layers as shown by Teixeira et al.andwhere R m represents the radius of shell m with electron density ρ m . Teixeira et al. tried to fit theoretical scattering functions from helical model and from polydisperse cylindrical model to the scattering data from nanotube of hexaperi-hexabenzocoronene (HBC)-based molecules in THF. They showed that the helical model with hexagonal structure factor is superior to the polydisperse cylindrical model in the fit of their SAXS data. The scattering curves from the helical model represent the width of the oscillator and the depth of the minima of the data very well as shown in Fig.Other than these models, recently, form factor of helical ribbons was derived by Hamley

Structures at High q:
Scattering intensity at high q follows the Porod law, which describes the scattering behavior from the interface of the particleswhere S is the total surface area of the particles. The scattering behavior from TCFs can be described by the Ornstein-Zernike representation,(13:28)where I 0 is a prefactor and ξ is the correlation length of TCFs. In the case of polymer blends or polymer solutions, the scattering intensity from TCFs obeys the scattering function calculated on the basis of the random phase approximationIf the aggregates exhibit a crystalline nature, e.g., self-assembled aggregates of some LMOGs form crystalline fibers

Unified Approach of Multilevel Structures:
The Beaucage unified modelwhere G i , B i , R g,i , and P i represent the Guinier prefactor, a prefactor specific to the power-law scattering, the radius of gyration of the i-th level structure, and the exponent of the power-law scattering, respectively. In Eq. (

Contrast-Matching and Contrast Variation Methods in SANS and SAXS:
Contrast-matchingOtherwise anomalous or resonant contrast variation method is effectiveIn the SANS experiments, contrast variation or contrast-matching methods are very effective to probe internal structures in multicomponent complex systems, since neutron scattering length of deuterium is largely different from that of hydrogen as mentioned in the Introduction. Therefore, hydrogen/deuterium replacement can easily change SANS contrast almost without modification of their chemical properties. This SANS contrast variation method has been widely utilized in various soft materials such as colloids, polymers, composites of polymer-inorganic substances, and biological systems. In the following sections, we shall describe details of SANS and SAXS contrast variation methods and the recent application.

Scattering Equation of Multicomponent Systems:
The scattering intensity from the multicomponent systems with different ( p + 1) species (0 i p) can be described in the following formρ i is the scattering length density for i-th component, and S ij is the partial structure factor, which is defined bywhere n i (r) is the local density of component i at a position r. On the incompressible assumption, Eq. (13.30) is reduced to the following form:Thus, the scattering intensity of multicomponent systems is composed of both self-terms and cross-terms of the partial structure factors. For the ternary system, the scattering intensity can be expressed by

SANS Contrast-Matching and Contrast Variation Methods:
In the small-angle scattering, the scattering length density is calculated from the chemical composition of the particles or the molecules.  First of all, let us consider a three-component system composed of an inorganic nanoparticle, a polymer, and a solvent (water). Here if components 0, 1, and 2 denote solvent, inorganic nanoparticle, and polymer, respectively, and the scattering contrast between the inorganic nanoparticle and the solvent is matched, i.e., ρ i = ρ s , then Eq. (13.33) leads toHere subscripts i, p, and s denote inorganic nanoparticle, polymer, and solvent species, respectively. In order to determine the scattering length density of the inorganic nanoparticles, the scattering intensity from the nanoparticles dispersed in H 2 O/D 2 O is measured. Since the scattering intensity I(0) at q = 0 is proportional to the square of the scattering contrast as shown in Eq. (13.10), there is a linear relationship between ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi I 0 ð Þ p and Δρ. Therefore, the matching point can be obtained from a plot of ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi I 0 ð Þ p vs. ϕ D as shown in Fig.Contrast-matching SANS presents information on the chain conformation in a polymer nanocompositeIn the case of contrast variation method, scattering experiments with different scattering contrasts, e.g., changing ratio of H 2 O/D 2 O in aqueous systems are carried out.Recently, Endo et al. developed SANS contrast variation method to evaluate partial structure factors in multicomponent systems such as microemulsion systems or block copolymer systems including inorganic materialsand M is a matrix related to scattering contrasts composed of the following form for ternary systems,where j ρ 0 is a scattering length density of the solvent in the j-th experiments ( j = 1, ˖˖˖, n). S denotes a vector of partial structure factorsThus, the partial structure factors can be obtained using orthogonal matrix M T from Eq. (13.36):This sophisticated method has been applied to various soft materials such as polymer-clay nanocomposite hydrogels

Application in Contrast Variation SANS Method:
Recently, a variety of polymer nanocomposite systems have attracted many researchers from a viewpoint of potential application of materials in various fields. Accordingly, numerous studies have been made on polymer-inorganic nanocompositesHere let us show a structural analysis of polymer-clay nanocomposite hydrogels using the above contrast variation method. Haraguchi et al. developed polymer-clay nanocomposite hydrogels with excellent properties such as high extensibility, mechanical toughness, and self-healing by using in situ free radical polymerization of N-alkylacrylamide in the presence of inorganic clayThe scattering contrast of the nanocomposite hydrogel in SANS can be easily changed by variation of mixing ratios between light water and heavy water. Endo, Shibayama, and Haraguchi et al. investigated structures of clay (Laponite)-poly(Nisopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) nanocomposite hydrogels with the sophisticated contrast variation SANS as shown in the previous sectionThe scattering curves reconstructed from the partial structure factors obtained thus are in good agreement with the original experimental SANS curves (Fig.Taking into consideration a layer of polymer chains adsorbed on clay particles as shown in Fig.β and J 1 are the same in Eq. (13.18). The partial structure factor S cc (q) is written as follows:P c (q) and S c , app (q) are the form factor of clay particles and the apparent structure factor, which are described by Eqs.The partial structure factor S cc (q) is similar to the overall SAXS profile of a clay-anionic polymer nanocomposite hydrogel for an unstretched sample as shown in Fig.On the other hand, the cross-term S cp (q) reflects the structure of the adsorption layer. If there is no correlation between polymer and clay particles, i.e., no adsorption layer, S cp (q) becomes negativeThe sophisticated contrast variation SANS method is effective for other multicomponent systems. Takenaka et al. carried out structural analysis by using the contrast variation SANS method for swollen rubber-silica and rubber-carbon black systems, considering a polymer layer adsorbed on the particles

Contrast Variation in SAXS: Anomalous SAXS:
When SAXS measurements were conducted near absorption edge of elements, the scattering length f(E) becomes a complex quantity as shown in Fig.where f 0 is the nonresonant term which is proportional to the atomic number of the element and the resonant terms f 0 (E) and f 00 (E) are the real and imaginary components of the energy-dependent anomalous dispersion. When anomalous SAXS measurements are performed, the scattering amplitude F (q, E) is composed of two parts as followsIn the past, anomalous SAXS has been mainly applied to hard materials such as ceramics, metal catalyst, and metal alloys, which are composed of elements with a high atomic numberWhen the measurement is performed near the absorption edge of K shell of Br, F R (q, E) can be written as follows:V(q) corresponds to the Fourier transform of the distribution function of Br, i.e., V 2 (q) corresponds to the form factor derived from the spatial distribution of Br. Using Eq. (13.10), the anomalous scattering intensity I(q, E) is presented by(13:49)since P(q, E) = F(q, E) F(q, E)*. In dilute systems, S(q) approaches 1 as mentioned above. In practice V 2 (q) can be obtained from difference between different scattering profiles measured at different energiesassuming S(q) = 1. Thus, using the scattering intensity measured at three different energies of X-rays (E 1 , E 2 , E 3 ), V 2 (q) can be obtained in the following form:Akiba et al. performed anomalous SAXS measurements at three different energies of incident X-rays near the absorption edge of bromine (13.473 keV, 13.453 keV, 13.283 keV) in order to probe the internal structure of polymer micelles comprising poly(4-bromostyrene)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(4-bromostyrene) in an aqueous solution

Time-Resolved Scattering Measurements:
Aggregated structures are developed via various processes such as liquid-liquid phase separation, crystallization, gelation, and micellization. Investigation of the kinetics is very important in order to understand the mechanism of their processes. Time-resolved scattering measurements have been performed for investigation of such kinetics. Especially, synchrotron SAXS technique is a very powerful tool to pursue a fast process, since high brilliance of synchrotron radiation makes it possible to obtain such precise data at a very short accumulation timeTime-resolved SANS measurements also may be useful in some casesSometimes repeating experiments are performed in order to overcome a poor statistical accuracy, and the average scattering data are analyzedHere we shall show a gelation process of a LMOG investigated by using timeresolved synchrotron SAXS. FigureLund et al. designed a stopped-flow apparatus for rapid mixing and investigated the micellization kinetics of both surfactant and block copolymer micelles

Complementary Utilization of SAXS and SANS:
In some soft material systems, complementary use between SAXS and SANS is effective to clarify the complex structuresThe former behavior indicates cylindrical-like behavior as shown in Fig.Eyssautier and Barre et al. performed SAXS and SANS measurements for precise structural analysis of nanoaggregates of asphaltene, which is high molecular substances in crude oilZemb and Diat pointed out importance of combined SAXS and SANS measurements of the same sample containing surfactants, which allow decomposition into form and structure factorsComplementary utilization of SAXS and SANS has been used in hard materials such as metal alloys as well as soft materials. Ohnuma et al. determined the chemical composition of the nanosized oxide in the steel matrix using the alloy contrast variation (ACV) methodBesides, combination of small-angle scattering and other techniques such as in situ simultaneous SAXS and UV-vis, SAXS and Raman

Conclusions and Future PerspectiveIn this chapter we have reviewed recent structural studies of soft materials such as polymeric micelles, low molecular weight organogels, polymer-clay nanocomposite gels, and so on. It has been shown that small-angle scattering methods such as synchrotron SAXS, USAXS, SANS, and USANS are powerful to probe structures of soft materials. Moreover, we have shown that combined scattering methods are very effective to clarify hierarchical structures. The hierarchical organization is composed of various structural levels, which depend upon the system, e.g., in the case of low molecular weight organogels, (i) spherulites, (ii) network (or fractal) structure, (iii) fibrous aggregates, (iv) cross-sectional structure of fibrous aggregates, and (v) crystalline organization in fibrous aggregates. Accompanying high performance of materials, their structures become more complicated. Therefore, it has been emphasized that sophisticated structural analysis for complex systems is indispensable. In general, however, structural analysis in multicomponent systems, e.g., that of three phases or more, becomes dramatically complex in comparison with two-phase or one-phase systems. We have shown that contrast variation SANS method using mixtures of hydrogenated and deuterated solvents with different ratios and anomalous SAXS near the absorption edge of an element are suitable for internal structural studies of multicomponent systems. The scattering intensities measured with different scattering contrasts can be decomposed into partial structure factor of each component. The partial structure factors obtained thus presents important information on the self-correlation between nanoparticles, that between polymers, and the cross-correlation between nanoparticles and polymers.In the future, importance of these combined methods and contrast variation methods will increase more and more with the development of high-performance materials. In practice the contrast variation SANS method introduced in this topic has been recently used for structural analysis of various high-performance materials, e.g., catalyst ink of fuel cell

Definition of the Topic:
Quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) is a part of more general inelastic neutron scattering and is a very powerful technique to explore the motions in biomolecules, polymers, simple liquids, alloy melts, and soft matter in general. In this chapter, we will discuss basic theoretical aspects of QENS, instrumentation, types of motion in liquids and solids, understanding these motions from the QENS data, and recent studies using QENS.

Overview:
The QENS is a versatile technique to study the relaxation processes in the condensed materials, particularly in liquids. This technique typically uses cold neutrons as the energy of the cold neutrons is in a similar range with relaxation process in liquids and the wavelength is of the order of the interatomic distance in condensed materials. The QENS techniques can provide much more information on the relaxation processes (motions) as compared to other techniques, e.g., dielectric spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and tracer diffusion measurements. The QENS technique is particularly helpful for understanding the microscopic dynamics of soft and biomaterials since these materials contain a large number of hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogen atom is very sensitive to neutron scattering due to a large scattering cross section. Neutron scattering offers not only QENS but also other scattering techniques like diffraction, inelastic, reflectometry, triple axis, small-angle scattering, and neutron imaging. However, facilities available for neutron scattering research are very few in the world. The production of neutrons is very expensive and typically requires either a nuclear reactor or a target-based source and also detection of neutrons needs materials like 3 He, which is rare on earth, are the reason for it. Over the last few decades, few neutron scattering facilities like Spallation Neutron Source, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), Australian Neutron Scattering Facility, Forschungsreaktor Munchen (FRM)-II Germany, ISIS-UK, and JAPARK at Japan have been built. Also, there has been tremendous improvement in neutron scattering instrumentations, particularly building of new backscattering and spin echo spectrometers in the abovementioned facilities. At present relaxation process in a time scale of 0.1 ps-350 ns can be measured using neutron scattering.In the beginning, QENS was mainly used to study the diffusion in simple liquids and hydrogen diffusion, in metals, etc. At present the QENS technique has been used in many fields of science ranging from colloids, polymers, ionic liquids, hydrogen storage, food processing, biotechnology, and environments. In this chapter we will provide an overview of basic theoretical understanding of QENS, concepts of instrumentation, data analysis, identification of transport mechanism from QENS data, and recent research results using QENS.

Introduction:
Atomic/molecular relaxation processes in condensed materials, particularly the long-range atomic/molecular diffusion process, are very important for many technological developments. For example, crystal growth from the melts, alloy design, nano-device fabrications, etc., require the knowledge of diffusion processes. In the field of basic science, glass transition is controlled by diffusion, and it is still an unresolved problem in condensed matter physics. Particularly, a reason for severalfold increase in the diffusivity of fragile glass-forming liquids in a short interval of temperature is not yet understood. Understanding the function of protein, DNA, and RNA is extremely important in life science, which is controlled by diffusion process. Therefore, accurately measuring the diffusion of atoms/molecules is unambiguously important in many fields of science and technology. The atomic/molecular diffusion in condensed materials can be measured by several techniques, dynamic light scattering (DLS)The DLS can only be used to study transparent or nearly transparent liquids, and DS and NMR cannot be used to study metallic liquids. The dynamic range of XPCS technique is few milliseconds to ten thousand seconds, and this technique is mainly used to understand the relaxation process in glassy materials. The main advantage of QENS is that the momentum transfer range in the interatomic distance can be measured which allows to distinguish between different types of atomic/molecular transport mechanism in liquids. For example, QENS can distinguish between Brownian and jump-diffusion processes based on the observed momentum transfer dependence of relaxation time. In the case of jump-diffusion process, in-cage rattling process (β-relaxation) and long-range diffusion process (α-relaxation) can be separately analyzed from QENS data. Additionally, the residence time and jump length in the jump-diffusion process can also be calculated from a QENS experiment. Measurements of these quantities are not possible with any other techniques. Moreover, the intermediate scattering function derived from a QENS experiment can readily be calculated by molecular dynamics simulation or ab initio molecular dynamics simulation; hence, there is a close correlation between theory and experiments which will help further in the understanding of the dynamic processes in condensed materials

Theory of Quasi-Elastic Neutron ScatteringIn a typical neutron scattering experiment, a beam of neutrons with a narrow, welldefined energy (or wavelength) distribution is focused onto the sample. The narrow energy distribution around the energy of interest is typically achieved by monochromating the incident beam which is accomplished by many different ways depending on the instrument design. When the monochromatized incident beam of neutrons collides with the atoms in the sample, the strong nuclear interaction scatter the neutrons in various directions. The crucial information about the dynamics (or structure) in the sample can be obtained as this scattering phenomena changes energy distribution of the scattered neutrons with respect to the initial distribution. Typically, if the time scale of motions matches the time range of the instrument, then a strong interaction between neutrons and atoms of material under consideration is expected. On the other hand, if the motions are too slow, then most of the neutrons scatter elastically without much dynamic interaction with atoms. The dynamic range offered by an instrument defines how fast motions can be probed with respect to the instrumental resolution, which is the slowest possible measurement on an instrument. Typically, to match the time scales of atomic motions in material under consideration with the instrument, either temperature, pressure, or some other external variable is varied. There are two kinds of inelastic scattering that are typically observed in soft matter. The first is called inelastic scattering in which the shift in scattered peak from the incident energy indicates the energy of the excitation. This kind of scattering is typically observed in materials that have well-defined energy excitations, e.g., methyl group rotations in crystalline materials. Purely inelastic scattering is typically not observed in soft materials. The second type of scattering appears as broadening of the incident energy distribution over the elastic scattering and is typically referred to as QENS. This is the most relevant type of scattering that is observed in soft materials.Neutrons possess a number of important properties that makes the neutron scattering technique so powerful in exploring motions particularly in soft matter physics. First, the wavelength of most facility produced neutrons range between 1 A ånd 10 A ˚, which overlaps nicely with typical interatomic or intermolecular distances in soft organic materials. The length scale of the motions over which a motion is probed by a neutron depends on the wavelength of the neutron and is given by the scattering vector Q = 4πsin(θ)/λ. In the above expression, Q is the momentum transfer of neutron, θ is the scattering angle, and λ is the neutron wavelength. The momentum transfer Q is inversely related to the length scales probed by the neutrons. Accesses length scales by an instrument depend on a number of parameters; typically instruments probe scattering over a range of angles which provide Q range between 0.1 A ˚À1 < Q < 3.0 A ˚À1 . In real space this will correspond to length scales approximately 2 A ˚-60 A ˚, well suited for characterizing local atomic and molecular motions in soft materials. The second property of neutrons that makes them useful for measuring soft matter dynamics is their energies. If we calculate energies corresponding to the neutron wavelengths mentioned above, cold neutrons will have energies of the order of a few meVs. This energy is on the same order of magnitude as the activation energies for many of the solid state excitations, molecular relaxations, and dynamic processes that occur in soft materials. This simply means when a neutron gains or loses energy from a dynamic interaction with the sample, the change in the energy of the neutron is a significant fraction of the initial neutron energy and, therefore, easy to measure with certainty. In addition, due to their low energies (e.g., in comparison to X-rays), neutrons are typically nondestructive and sample is not altered or destroyed during or after the experiment which is very important particularly for biological samples.The neutrons are either produced by nuclear fission (splitting of nucleus of heavy atoms) or spallation process (high-energy particles hit on heavy nucleus) and have high energies. The high-energy neutrons have to slow down to be used for QENS experiments because the energy of neutron should be comparable to the energy of diffusion process in the condensed materials. As we mentioned above, the energy of diffusion process in liquids is of the order of few meV. The cold neutron can be obtained by passing the high-energy neutrons through helium kept at 25 K (moderator), and outgoing neutrons will have an energy centered at 25 meV. The cold neutrons are nonrelativistic particles so the energy-momentum relationship iswhere p is the momentum and m n is the neutron mass. Using de Broglie and Plank's equation p ¼ ℏk and k ¼ 2π=λ , the wavelength of a thermal neutron can be written asFor E = k B T = 300 K, λ = 1.8 A ˚. As we can see, the thermal energy of the neutrons is comparable with the energy of vibrational and diffusional energy in condensed materials, and the wavelength is comparable with the interatomic distance in condensed materials. Every element in the periodic table has a unique value of coherent and incoherent cross section. These values are available on the NIST neutron scattering center webpageThe total measured intensity in a neutron scattering experiment is a summation of incoherent and coherent intensities from the sample. For coherent scattering events, there is a spatial correlation between the scatterings from different atoms of the same type. These spatial correlations allow us to determine the pair-pair correlation function, i.e., the spatial correlations between the different atoms of same type as a function of time and space. These correlations are often related with structures or the dynamics of such structures. For incoherent scattering, single particle is considered as there is no correlation between pairs of atoms. This kind of scattering leads to what is known as self-correlation functions. In this correlation function, the probability of finding the particle in a position after time t (defined by the energy exchange) is calculated. From the energy and angular dependence of the incoherent scattering, one can determine the time and length scale of the self-motions in soft matter. As most soft materials are hydrocarbons, their incoherent scattering is very strong and dominates the measured signal. If the pair correlation function is desired, then typically isotopic substitution is performed and hydrogens are replaced with deuterium that reduces incoherent scattering and coherent scattering can be enhanced and measured. Quasi-elastic neutron scattering is one of the most direct methods to quantify the time and length scales of soft matter dynamics in general.In a QENS experiment, the quantities of interest are changes in energy and momentum transfers during the scattering process. The momentum transfer is directly measured from the angle of the scattering. To calculate the energy change of neutrons in a scattering process, the time-of-flight of the neutron from the sample to the detectors could be measured. The time-of-flight will be shorter if the neutrons gain energy or longer if the neutrons lose energy during the scattering process. The energy change and momentum transfer can be expressed in the form of double differential scattering cross section:k f and k i are scattered and incident wave vectors, respectively, and σ is the scattering cross section, dΩ is the solid angle, and dω is the energy changeÞis called self-correlation function and G d (r, t) is called pair correlation function. Gs(r, t) is the probability of finding the same particle at one point at t = 0 and at a later time t at the distance r. G d (r, t) is the probability for finding two different particles of same type at a position R i (0) and R j (t) separated by a distance r and at a time interval t. Following information about dynamic process can be obtained from incoherent and coherent scattering process and summarize what we discussed above: Incoherent scattering: no spatial coherence in scattered neutrons and a constant intensity at different angle • Information on single particle: -Elastic incoherent scattering (Debye-Waller factor) : elastic incoherent structure factor geometry of diffusive motion -Inelastic: diffusive dynamics (continuous, jump, rotations, jump length, residence time, and diffusion coefficients) Coherent scattering: spatial coherence and intensity is due to superposition of scattered waves • Gives information on spatial correlations and collective motion:-Elastic: Where are the atoms? What are the shapes of objects? -Inelastic: Excitation spectrum -e.g., phonons.-Coherent QENS: Collective diffusion, shape fluctuation, α-relaxation.Therefore, single particle dynamics can be studied in materials that have dominant incoherent scattering cross section. As we know that the hydrogen atom is the strongest incoherent neutron scattering element in the periodic table, QENS is the best technique for studying the diffusive dynamics in hydrogenated materials like polymers, colloids, and biomaterials.

Types of Motions in Condensed Materials:
Apart from the vibrational motions, atom/molecules in liquids move randomly due to microscopic density (thermal) fluctuations. The random motion is influenced by the density of the liquid. In the low-density liquids, particles hit and move randomly on Brownian dynamics. However, as the density increases, atoms form cages by its neighboring atoms. In such liquids atoms initially rattle in the cage formed by its neighboring atoms for a short time and move to the next cage. This process is called jump diffusion

Designing of QENS Experiments:
Every QENS spectrometer has its time window in which the dynamic process in the sample can be measured. The time window is defined by the wavelength and dynamic range accessible in the spectrometer. The typical time window of a chopper spectrometer is 0.05-10 ps and that of backscattering spectrometer is 50-5000 ps. So there should be an idea of time scale on which the dynamic process might be present in our sample for choosing the appropriate spectrometer. Sample size also matters in the QENS experiments. This is due to multiple scattering processes. Multiple scattering refers to the interaction of neutron with more than one atom before leaving the sample. To avoid multiple scattering, the thickness of the sample is chosen in a way that 90 % of neutrons are transmitted through the sample. By considering macroscopic coherent, incoherent, and absorption cross sections of the sample, the transmission coefficient can be calculated. For example, water is a very commonly studied material with QENS and water contains oxygen and two hydrogen atoms. The transmission, T, relates to thickness, t, as! is the macroscopic cross section: Σ ¼ nσ. n is the number density (number of atoms in a unit volume) (atoms/cm 3 ). σ ! is the microscopic cross section (barns/atom) The dynamic processes and relaxations that occur in soft matter span a broad range of time and length scales. To optimize instrument characteristics and functionality, generally, different instruments are designed to cover different ranges of time and length scales. A classic diagram showing time and energy against length scales is shown in Fig.

Neutron Spin Echo Spectrometer:
The neutron spin echo technique exploits neutron's spin and magnetic moment in a magnetic field. Polarized neutrons travel through two symmetric magnetic fields before and after the sample. At the sample a π spin flip occurs by a flipper. If the scattering process is strictly elastic, the Larmor precession angles in the two fields are equal and opposite, so that full polarization is recovered, irrespective of the initial neutron energy distribution

Backscattering Spectrometer:
The BS spectrometer is an inverse geometry spectrometer where the final energy of neutrons is fixed. The details of the high-flux backscattering spectrometer (HFBS) installed at NIST are described in Fig.The energy resolution offered by HFBS is about 0.85 μeV FWHM, which means motions faster than 205 MHz can be explored by the HFBS spectrometer; slower motions appear as static and show up as elastic line. The maximum energy window defined by Doppler frequency is AE 36 μeV. All scattering events outside of the energy window, associated with fast relaxation processes, appear as background under the scattering spectrum. The other two major backscattering spectrometers that employ the concept of PST chopper are located at ILLAnother backscattering spectrometer has been installed at the spallation neutron source at Oak Ridge. BASIS

Time-of-Flight Spectrometer:
The TOF spectrometer is based on the concept of measuring the flight time of neutron. It operates on the principle that when scattered neutrons gain energy, they speed up, while neutrons slow down when they lose energy, and by measuring this accurately energy distribution can be established. A schematic in Fig.The fixed window scan (FWS) or the elastic scans are easiest to analyze and interpret as simply all scattered neutrons are counted as a function of an external parameter, e.g., temperature or pressure. A first-order phase transition shows up like a step in elastic intensity. If a relatively smeared change in elastic intensity is observed, this typically means that neutrons are interacting strongly with the sample, and therefore dynamics is well suited for BS time scales in that, e.g., temperature range. In order to understand the details about molecular motions under investigation, it is necessary to model the Q and T dependence of the observed QENS data. As we mentioned above, Q and ω dependence of the scattered neutrons contain all the spatial and temporal characteristics information of the dynamics that fall within the energy and Q resolution of the spectrometer. Most QENS measurements in soft materials focus on the incoherent neutron scattering given that the incoherent cross section dominates the scattering for hydrogenous materials and, therefore, provide self-correlation function of the hydrogens. This measured dynamic structure factor S(Q,ω) or S(Q,t) must be normalized properly (discussed below) before being modeled suitably. The process of choosing an appropriate model for the motion is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, there are several textbooks dedicated to this subject; see, e.g., Refs.

Reduction of QENS Data:
Following procedures are normally applied to get S(Q,ω) of the sample which are corrected for instrument factors and container scattering.(a) Monitor normalization: For certain QENS experiments, the absolute values of intensity from different samples may need to be compared. As the neutron flux either from a reactor or spallation source varies with time, incoming neutron flux has to be normalized for such studies. This is done by measuring total count of neutrons before hinting the sample. A beam monitor is placed in front of the sample to count the total flux of incoming neutrons that hit the samples, and the total counts of the monitor are normalized with the detector counts. (b) Vanadium normalization (detector efficiency correction): The efficiency of detectors may be different, and correcting the detector efficiently is done by normalizing the scattered data from pure vanadium having geometry similar to the sample. The reason for choosing the vanadium is that it is purely an incoherent scatterer, and scattered intensity is roughly independent of angle of scattering. (c) Self-absorption correction and background: As the neutrons pass through samples, it may get absorbed by the sample and container. In addition, sample containers can scatter neutrons as well. These factors need to be taken into account for deducing S(Q,ω). Following equation is generally used to correct for absorption and container scattering to get the absolute scattering from the samplek B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. (e) Multiple scattering corrections: This is the case where the sample cannot be made thin enough and multiple scattering become dominant. In such cases the Q dependence of the relaxation time found to deviate for small Q values. There are few computer programs available for multiple scattering corrections

QENS Data Analysis:
A soft matter system, in general, exhibits a broad spectrum of relaxation processes whose characteristic times range from picoseconds to seconds. This makes the modeling slightly more challenging unlike molecular crystals where a welldefined model can be used to extract parameters that characterize a particular dynamic mode. The QENS data fitting and analysis often require trial and error since satisfying results need to achieve an acceptable mathematical fitting as well as make physical sense. The general Eq. 14.8 to model the QENS data can be read aswhere DWF is the Debye-Waller factor, A(Q) is the elastic incoherent structure factor (EISF), δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function at zero frequency, S QE (Q,ω) is the quasi-elastic scattering model function, and BKG is the background. In the above equation, DWF takes into account all faster vibrational processes. For diffusive or diffusive-like processes, EISF approaches zero, which makes the data analysis simpler. For non-diffusive motions, EISF provides crucial information about the geometry of the motion. The Dirac delta function accounts for any processes that are slower than instrumental resolution, and typically flat background accounts for any processes that are faster than that can be accessed by instrument dynamic (or time) window. As the QENS measured data is resolution broadened, the above equation should be convoluted with instrumental resolution before it can be fitted to the measured experimental data. The first commonly used approach is to treat the QE signal, S QE (Q,ω), by a single Lorentzian functionAs Fourier transform of a Lorentzian function is a simple exponential function in the time domain, a Lorentzian function can be interpreted as a purely exponential relaxation process with a single relaxation time τ. In a liquid, atoms or molecules diffuse away in space with time due to relatively small molecular size. This shows up in the measured intermediate scattering function as it decays exponentially with relaxation time τ. This relaxation time depends on the diffusion constants and can be given by τ Q ð Þ ¼ D À1 Q À2 where D is the diffusion constant. In molecular liquids, individual molecules go through both rotational and translational motions. This means while the center of mass translates in space, these molecules also orient and reorient about their center of mass. Typically, it is assumed that these two motions are statistically uncorrelated and can be expressed separately. In the frequency domain, this scenario translates to a sum of two Lorentzians. As translational motion is strongly dependent on spatial access, typically there is a strong Q dependence of relaxation time or full width at half maximum (FWHM) that is typically accessed in frequency domain. In frequency domain, such a Q dependence can be fitted to jump-diffusion model aswhere τ 0 is residence time. The local character of rotational motion typically produces Q-independent time scales or FWHM. As we discussed above, NSE directly measures the intermediate scattering function, S(Q,t), and therefore, data reduction is much simpler as no convolution with the instrumental resolution is needed and it simply can be divided. The above modeling generally works for simple liquids. However, for polymer segmental motion, a single Lorentzian (or two Lorentzians) is, often, not enough, and, usually, a stretched-exponential function or Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) functionn o (14:10)In the above equation, τ is the characteristic relaxation time and β (0<β<1) is the stretched-exponential shape parameter defining the non-exponential behavior of the relaxation. The KWW function has been very successful in describing the dynamics of amorphous liquids and polymer segmental motions in literature. The KWW model can be thought of as a distribution of relaxation times and has also been interpreted in heterogeneous and homogeneous scenarios of the molecular dynamics

Review of Recent Studies:
In recent years QENS has been used for studying relaxation process in various materials, which includes ionic liquid, organic liquids, water, proton-conducting materials, metallic glass-forming melts, biomaterials, polymers, and various materials in nano-or mesoporous confined states. There are about 40-50 research articles based on QENS experiments being published in every year since 1995. Among several fields of research explored by QENS in recent years, in this chapter we would like to discuss following important research result from QENS studies: dynamics in glass-forming alloy melts, dynamics of water in confinement, polymer under confinement, dynamics of uniquely synthesized nanoparticles, hydrogenbonded liquids in vycor, solution under confinement, dynamics of gas in nanopores, and energy storage applications.

Dynamics of Glass-Forming Alloy Melts:
The glass transition is a reversible transition. When a liquid is cooled below its melting temperature, it solidifies in the amorphous state. This phenomenon is generally called as glass transition. Irrespective of the nature of interatomic bonds or intermolecular bonds, in general, all liquids can be vitrified on fast cooling. According to the temperature dependence of viscosity the liquids, glass-forming materials are generally classified into two groups: strong and fragileTo study the relaxation dynamics in the metallic supercooled liquids, electromagnetic and electrostatic levitation techniques have been used to overcome the crystallization problemProf. Andreas Meyer was the first one to carry out a detailed study on the dynamics of dense metallic glass-forming liquids. He has investigated the atomic relaxation process in Zr-and Pd-based alloy meltswhere f Q is the Debye-Waller factor and h Q amplitude of β-relaxation process. The scaling function g λ (t/t σ ) is defined by ISF shape parameter λ. The QENS data from Zr-and Pd-based melts found to follow the above equation and results from the fitting of Eq. 14.12 provided the crossover time t σ and h Q , which are temperaturedependent parameter. Error bars throughout the text represent one standard deviation unless defined otherwise. The MCT predicted that close to Tc the temperature dependence of t σ and h Q with the scaling function,From the temperature dependence of the t σ and h Q (Eq. 14.13), the critical temperature (Tc) of the system was found out. The Tc calculated using the above equations found to be about 1.2-1.3 times the calorimetric glass-transition temperature (Tg). By tracer diffusion technique, Ratzke et al. have measured the diffusion coefficient of Co atoms in the Pd-P-based alloy, and it shows a clear change in the diffusion process from an Arrhenius process to non-Arrhenius process at a critical temperature of 1.2-1.3Tg, thus confirming the Tc obtained from the β-relaxation process that was observed by the QENS experimentsAccording to MCT the T c can also be derived from the α-relaxation process and the relaxation time of the α-process is controlled by packing fraction of the liquid. The metallic liquids can be approximated by closed packed hard spheres, and the packing fraction can be calculated from the following equation: ϕ ¼ πnr 3 =6, where n is the number density and r is the radius of the sphere (atom). The critical packing fraction ϕ c is related to relaxation time as follows

Early Work Overview:
It will be an understatement to say that water is the most important material on our planet. What makes water such a unique liquid is the fact that the physical properties of water are very different than a typical liquid. Water has been known to exhibit anomalous behavior in transport as well as thermodynamic properties, particularly below melting temperatureThe dynamics of water evolved slowly over the years, starting more than 30 years ago. In earlier days, water was studied using incoherent QENS, coherent inelastic neutron scattering, X-ray scattering, as well as molecular dynamics simulations. First incoherent scattering measurements were reported by Chen et al.

Recent Work Overview:
Studies of water confined in vycor pores were limited due to a broad distribution of pore sizes. In addition, average pore size was about 50 A ˚which was not enough to completely supercool water and therefore explore water dynamics in deep supercooled regime. This problem was somewhat resolved by using a new mesoporous silica as confining materialThe above equation is very similar to standard KWW function described above. However, the main difference comes from the fact that there is a well-defined meaning of each term. In the above equation, first term describes the rattling motion of the molecule inside the cage of its neighbors that can be described using a simple Gaussian term. The long term or the relaxation term is characterized by a structural relaxation time τ. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experiments have shown that relaxation term follows a power law in Q of the form τ $ Q Àγ . If the exponent γ is 2, this would simply mean simple diffusion in space. MD resultsChu et al.How accurately FSC can really be determined has always been a question. We were able to determine the crossover temperature without artifact of the data analysis by using a different approachIn an attempt to understand the origin of FSC, Mamontov and coworkers studied water dynamics in surface water at low hydration levels on rutileIn continuation, to understand dynamics and transport properties of interfacial water, Faraone et al.

Polymers Under Confinement:
Dynamics of polymers under high degree of confinement and on filler particles is very interesting for theoretical physics as well as for application purpose as confinement tend to alter a number of their important properties including their modulus. For example, previous work on polymers (PMMA, TMPC) containing C60 nanoparticles suggest that local segmental motions are suppressed due to the presence of nanoparticlesWe studied confinement effects on the segmental dynamics of 1,4 polybutadiene (PBD) in the presence of a high concentration of carbon black as filling particlesFor the accurate determination of shape parameter, we measured dynamic mechanical loss modulus in almost seven orders of magnitude in frequency. We found a β = 0.41 for the neat PBD while modulus of PBD/CB obviously broadened and an approximate β = 0.38 fitted the data well although some deviations at lower frequencies remain. This is consistent with common notion that polymer spectra get broadened by the addition of nanoparticles. These same values were used for QENS data and fitted the data well. The Q dependence is shown in Fig.The neat PBD shows a sharp upturn in the MSD measured by backscattering in the range ofA great deal of information can also be had via diffusion constant and residence time (Eq. 14.9) determined for the slow mode. What is interesting is that slow modes show different temperature dependence for neat and CB sample. In addition, they seem to separate at lower temperatures, while there is not that much of a difference at higher temperatures. These results clearly show that at lower temperatures higher restrictions are observed on the dynamics of PBD due to CB. In addition, we found that wait time at the same temperature increased almost 80 % when going from neat to CB sample although average jump length increased only by a small fraction. These results indicate that "transient locking" where atoms are reversibly adsorbed to carbon surface manifests slow dynamics.Boson peak has been known in amorphous systems for several decades now and general consensus is that they represent the excess density of vibrational states. Their origin is proposed to be due to the transverse vibrational modes associated with defective soft structure in the disordered state

Dynamics of Uniquely Synthesized Nanoparticles:
In recent years somewhat unique nanoparticles have been synthesized that have their own functionality and therefore show their own dynamics. These modified nanoparticles have found usage in industries as well as in applications we use on a daily basis. In this subsection we discuss some of these systems and their dynamics. Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) are a class of condensed threedimensional oligomeric organosilica compounds with cage frameworks having different degrees of symmetryM-POSS was measured on backscattering in elastic mode and MSD was calculated result of which is shown in Fig.QENS was measured at BASIS in the temperature range of 100 K-350 K. The data were fitted to a delta function and a Lorentzian function that takes care of broadening from the methyl groups. The symmetrical methyl groups rotate around their C 3 axes and can be modeled with a 3-site jump modelwhere d is the jump distance separating the hydrogen atoms undergoing the rotational diffusion and j 0 is the spherical Bessel function of order zero. As can be seen, data can be fitted reasonably well (Fig.Proton exchange membranes for fuel cell have been good candidate to replace existing energy materials due to their appeal as clean source of energy for numerous applications. Typically PEMs are based on Nafion which relies heavily on water for conductivity as low water content Nafion films cannot provide enough conductivity for applications. In a recent work, we synthesized highly dense sulfonic acid functionalized mesoporous electrolytes that exhibit high proton conductivity under dry conditionsAs can be seen in Fig.These direct comparisons clearly show additional broadening results from the sulfonic acid sites only. FigureSimilar to the modified MCM above, 1,3diphenylpropane (DPP) was covalently tethered via a silyl-aryl-ether linkage in the mesopores of MCM-41

Hydrogen-Bonded Liquids in Vycor:
As we mentioned above, for simple liquids, general consensus is that there is a surface or interfacial layer of molecules tightly bound to the walls, while the remaining space is filled with bulk-like liquid. The connection between the surface wetting and observed dynamics has been investigated for over a decade. The dielectric relaxation of three glass formers with one (salol), two (pentylene glycol), and three hydroxyl groups (glycerol) showed that the thickness of the interfacial layer grows with increasing surface wetting and thickens as the temperature is reducedThe elastic intensity falls off more rapidly in confined samples than bulk. What is very interesting to see is the change in the way intensity drops off even at lower temperature. In case of glycerol, elastic intensity drops off faster in bulk before a sharper change in slope at 260 K occurs. The upturn at 260 K is related to the glass transition, and therefore, a change in T dependence below 260 K shows local and secondary relaxations that are affected by confinement effects. On the other hand, elastic intensity from PNOL shows clear freezing on cooling in the form of a liquidto-solid phase transition. Interestingly, this drop is not observed in confined sample indicating confinement effects eliminated crystallization completely in PNOL. PG shows rather standard behavior of elastic intensity as it shows similar behavior for both bulk and confined until a sharp change in T dependence takes place at around 200 K.As discussed above, MSD can be calculated from the elastic intensities in the Gaussian approximation using Eq. 14.11. In principle, the Gaussian approximation term is the first term in Taylor expansion, which can be terminated after Q 2 term for harmonic solid as non-Gaussianity is absent. However, if non-Gaussian contributions kick in, then the more general expansion can be written asWe also analyzed the MSD data of confined samples to see if a direct correlation with bulk MSD can be made. We tried to scale the confined data to recover bulk MSD above the glass transition which shows up as a sharp upturn in MSD. Interestingly, MSD data of PNOL and PG can be scaled with bulk by using factors Fig.Therefore, the distribution ρ of relaxation time is strongly related with observed shape parameter β. As β decreases, the distribution broadened. In this sense, shape parameter can be considered as a direct measure of heterogeneity in the glass. However, there is a debate about the real origin of the non-exponential behavior in polymers, and it has also been suggested that non-exponential character of the relaxation does not need to be related to distribution and it could be inherent to the dynamicsAs we mentioned above, shape parameter and relaxation time are strongly coupled and therefore a comparison of temperature dependence of relaxation time in a given system is rather difficult if shape parameters show temperature dependence as well. This can be resolved if an average relaxation time is calculated as follows: The Q dependence follow a power law τ Q ð Þ / Q Àγ behavior at all temperatures for both bulk and confined liquids. For example, for PG at T = 307, 290 K, and 265 K, the exponent γ takes the values of 1.99, 1.65, and 1.68, respectively, while for confined PG, the exponent takes the values of 0.82 and 0.79 at the same temperatures. As can be seen, relatively much weaker Q dependence is observed for confined PG. This behavior is repeated for other two glass formers as well.Although these results point out a number of features of confined dynamics, still a clear relationship between the surface wetting strength and effect on relaxation is not observed. If we compare absolute values, we find that the measured shift in relaxation times at a given temperature of PG is higher than glycerol. A very naı ¨ve interpretation of this shift is that relaxation is less affected when the liquid-matrix interaction is stronger, opposing the general consensus that stronger surface wetting leads to slower dynamics. An alternative interpretation is that motions occurring within the interfacial layers are too slow to be detected by instrument, and the observed relaxation is actually coming from the molecules that are near the core. Therefore, the data can be interpreted in a two mutually conflicting ways depending on whether the instrument probes the behavior of all the samples or only the liquid core. These results press on the need for detail theoretical and simulation need in order to resolve these ambiguities from the data interpretation.

Solutions Under Confinement:
Unlike neat liquids, only a few dynamical and structural studies have been reported on binary liquids in nanopores. These include the following mixtures: water/ methanol, acetone/water, and isobutyric acid/water

Effect of Nanoparticles on Conductivity:
Polymer electrolytes are promising materials for electrochemical device applications particularly for rechargeable batteries and fuel cells. The area of polymer electrolyte has gone through various developmental stages from dry solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) to plasticized, gel, rubbery electrolytes to nanocomposite polymer electrolytes. In this development, neutron scattering has provided a tremendous amount of information about the role of polymer segmental dynamics in actual conduction and its mechanism. One of the major concerns that remains is the lower conductivities exhibited by these SPEs for real-world application. Accordingly SPEs have been modified in many ways to improve conductivity. One such modification is to improve the conductivity using nanoparticle fillers. Macrometersized ceramic fillers were used for a long time, but actual increase in conductivity was observed only when the size of the particle approached nanometer scale. The use of various fillers have substantially increased conductivity but still remains lower than that is required for practical purpose. Before we go into the details of how nanoparticles affect the conductivity in SPEs, it is important to understand how conductivity mechanism actually occurs in these materials. As far as the mechanism of conduction is concerned in SPEs, the common consensus is that Li ions move through the polymer host by breaking and reforming with ether oxygens, and somehow this transport mechanism is facilitated by segmental motions of polymer.In order to understand the role of nanoparticles, Fullerton et al. measured a number of lithiated polyethylene oxide samples with ether oxygen to lithium ratios ranging from 14:1 to 8:1 and Al 2 O 3 nanoparticle concentrations ranging from 5 wt% to 25 wt%

Methane Recovery from Coalbeds:
In recent years lots of efforts have been done to recover methane from unminable coalbeds. Methane is a clean burning gas and it has high energy per unit mass. Methane is mainly adsorbed inside the coalbed which is about 2 km deep where mining the coal is not economical. Getting out of the adsorbed methane from the deep coalbeds is technically very challenging. However, a new technique has been tried to tap the methane from deep coalbed by pumping carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) gas. Since the adsorption rate for CO 2 on the coal surface is approximately twice that of methane, it can potentially displace methane that remains sequestrated in the pores of coal seams.To optimize the process of methane extraction from the coalbed, knowledge of methane diffusivity under various temperature and pressure is necessary. Y. B. Melnichenkov and coworkers have reported the QENS studies on the diffusivity of methane under CO 2 and nitrogen (N 2 ) pressuresIt was observed that, and clear from the figure 14.19, methane diffuses faster with CO 2 pressure, while the diffusivity of methane did not change with N 2 pressure. This experiment clearly indicates that CO 2 displace the adsorbed methane from the surface of the carbon aerogel. They also reported pressure dependence of diffusivity of methane alone and observed that the diffusivity of methane increases up to a pressure of 3 MPa, but further increasing the pressure decreases the methane diffusivity

Energy Storage Applications:
The demand of the energy increases day by day and fossil fuels will run out in coming years. The efficient utilization of electrical energy generated from solar, wind, and other intermittent sources require significant improvements in the energy storage capacity of electric energy storage devices like batteries and EDLCs. In many applications where rapid charge-discharge is required, batteries alone are insufficient to meet the necessary needs; for example, electric vehicles require a coupling of supercapacitors with batteries or fuel cells to deliver the high power needed during accelerationElectric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) also known as supercapacitors offer a solution to the problem of fast charge-discharge ratesOnion-like carbon (OLC) is an allotrope of carbon with large surface area. Because of large surface area, it is one of the best electrode materials for EDLCs. We have studied the dynamics of three different RTILs with varying molecular size of cations; EMIM-Tf2N, HMIM-Tf2N, and BMIH-Tf2N on the ILC surfaces. The anions in the ionic liquids are the same, Tf2N. Tf2N is an aprotic molecule and not sensitive to neutron. In the bulk states, the diffusivity of cations in these liquids show molecular size dependence; the smaller molecules diffuse faster and bigger cations diffuse slower. However, on the OLC surface, the diffusivities of the RTILs did not show the size dependence.The diffusivity of biggest BMIH molecules was faster than that of HMIM (see Fig.J. P. Embs and collaborators reported the dynamics of pyridinium-based ionic liquids (1-butylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [BuPy][Tf2N] and 1-dodecylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [C12Py][Tf2N]) with different alkyl chain length. Similar to the previous observation in BMIM-Tf2N, the pyridinium-based ionic liquids also show two diffusive motions in different time scales, and the slower of these motions can be described by a jump-diffusion model. The faster motion is the in-cage localized dynamics, which is found to be more complex. The chain and the ring of the cations contribute to the localized process and resulted in two different values of diffusion coefficients or relaxation timesNeutron scattering has been used extensively to study polymer segmental motions under confinement. General consensus seems to be that overall polymer mobility under confinement is decreased. However, there seem to be cases where local segmental dynamics is affected by confinement, and in some cases, hardly any change on local dynamics is observed. In particular, the fast processes seem to remain unaffected by confinement effects. Nanoparticles have also been found very effective to increase conductivity in SPE. Using NS, a somewhat hindered rotation of (PEO) 6 :LiClO 4 has been characterized. The role of nanoparticles seems to be to act as a surface stabilizer which in turn provides a path for continuation and increased conduction in SPE. As nanoparticles are invisible to neutrons, conclusions about the role of nanoparticles have to be made rather indirectly. On the bright side, new materials are emerging that can be used as nanoparticles and exhibit their own dynamics. For example POSS seems to be very popular due to their use as polymer nanocomposites. We hope to learn the role of intrinsic dynamics of nanoparticles on the observed dynamics of guest molecules by employing such materials. This can particularly be interesting in identifying the role of nanoparticle in improving conductivity in SPE discussed above.
