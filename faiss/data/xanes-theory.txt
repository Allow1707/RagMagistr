Introduction:
Especially in the last decades, x-ray absorption spectrometry has gained much of its reputation of being a powerful analytical and research tool, mostly due to the use of synchrotron radiation sources. In this kind of spectrometry, interactions of photons with matter are studied by measuring the photoabsorption cross-section. For incident light with polarisation ˆ and frequency ω the cross section is given by the Fermi's golden rulewhere |i , |f , E i , and E f denote the initial and final states and their energies; k stands for the wave vector of the incident beam. Only the dipole contribution to the total cross-section has been considered in Eq.3 The theory of XANES

Multiple scattering formalism:
In this section we discuss scattering from potentials v i of several atoms or ions, each of which makes a non-zero contribution only within a spherically non-overlapping scattering region of finite radius (Fig.Outside the spherical regions -in the interstitial region -the potential is set to zero. This Figureapproximation is often used when describing condensed materials and is known as the muffintin approximation. The scattering parameters of each of the scatterers, i. e., the scattering amplitudes and phase shifts, are determined separately for each scatterer and are therefore pure atomic quantities. Propagation of a photoelectron in such muffin-tin potential V is described by the Hamiltonianwhere H 0 is the kinetic-energy operator. One is seeking the stationary solution |ψ with the energy E, H|ψ = E|ψ , (which can be twisted around a little bit to yieldWriting Eq. (3) in this way suggests treating the term V |ψ as a source and solving the "inhomogeneous" Eq. (then the general solution of Eq. (If the photoelectron is only weakly scattered by the potential V , the solution r|ψ is close to the free-electron solution r|φ . Furthermore, when V is identically zero everywhere, the exact equality r|ψ = r|φ holds, as expected. It is apparent from Eqs. (Because of its singularity, the operator 1/(E -H 0 ) has been modified by an imaginary term in the denominator, ±iη, where η is infinitesimally small and positive, η → 0 + . The form of Eq. (which becomes clear after inserting a complete system d 3 r |r r | into Eq. (where k = √ E. Obviously, G + 0 and G -0 describe how outgoing and incoming spherical waves propagate in free space, respectively. Through the rest of the paper we shall use only the "+" form of the propagators so the superscript will be omitted. The Lippman-Schwinger equation can be solved formally if the transition operator T is introducedIf we define the propagator G of the whole system asthe following important relationships can be deduced from Eq. (andRemembering that V = i v i and that the potentials are non-overlapping, we can write the transition operators of individual atoms asThe physical meaning of the operators T and t i is not obvious yet, but we will try to explain it by means of the "weak-scattering" expansions. When the scattering is weak, i. e., the photoelectron's path is not strongly affected by the potentials v i , equations (Let us first try to understand those last equations. Propagation of a particle -as described by G in Eq. (scattering on the potential v i alone: while the electron-wave propagates in the potential of the ith atom, it can, in principle, be scattered infinitely many times. Though in the case of strong scattering the expansions (Despite descriptive and elegant formulation with the operator algebra, one cannot avoid computing the matrix elements belonging to different operators when performing "real" calculations. Nevertheless, the operators t i and G can be cast into matrix form quite nicely using the angular-momentum representationIndices j, j and i are used to denote the atoms and L and L are the angular momenta (l, m) and (l , m ), respectively; k = √ E is the wave number of the incident wave. 1 For example, G jj LL describes how the partial wave with angular momentum L "transforms" to L when it propagates from j th to jth atom. The factor (1 -δ jj ) has been added in Eq. (where T = i t i and the multiplications used are simply matrix multiplications. This last expression is a geometric series for

Even more about photoabsorption cross-section:
Armed with the multiple scattering (MS) formalism, we are ready to proceed to the next problem.Let H be the total Hamiltonian H = H 0 + V and G(E) = 1/(E -H + iη) the Green's function that describes the propagation of the whole system. By inserting an arbitrary complete set of eigenstates, we obtainThe expression for photoabsorption cross-section [Eq.the cross-section formula can be rewritten aswhich gives usSince we are interested in the absorption of light, the step function θ(E i + ω -µ) has been added to assert that only excitations to free states above the chemical potential µ are considered.In some cases, the wave functions r|i and r|f can be determined from electronic-structure calculations and then used directly to obtain σ through Eq. (1). For example, in band structure calculations in crystals, the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the complete Hamiltonian H can be obtained using either Bloch and Wannier functions or by means of the tight-binding (LCAO) methodsConversely, the problem can be solved using the MS theory. At first we note that the complete set of eigenstates |f can be chosen to correspond to the atomic eigenstates.Since, as can be seen from Eq. (It is now clear that the density of final states is changed because of the presence of the scatterers. Thus, we are able to reinterpret the behaviour of our physical system: the solutions can be understood either as stationary solutions of the complete Hamiltonian or as solutions that are changed by the multiple scattering from surrounding atoms. For instance, in an N 2 molecule, the photoelectrons can get trapped to a virtual bound state of the molecule ("shape-resonance"), as seen through the eyes of molecular physics. Also, this can be understood as a strong scattering between two nitrogen atoms.So far, we have said almost nothing about the strong scattering which occurs when the kinetic energy of the knocked-out electron is small. The expansion

Example: Zn:
In the XANES regime, the photoelectrons populate unoccupied states above the chemical potential µ. Since -because of the scattered wave -the density of the final states changes, and along with it the charge density, the shape of the absorption edge of the same element is different in different chemical environments. Also, the electron binding (i. e., ionisation) energies change9650 9660 9670 9680 9690 9700 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Zn vapour Zn metal Zn(C 2 H 5 ) 2 ZnO ∆σ/σ 0 E [eV] for the same reason, which results in shifting of the absorption edge towards lower or higher energies. As an example, in Fig.With the muffin-tin approximation and with use of the Mattheiss prescription we mentioned in the previous section, a serious approximation is made. For example, if the potential in the interstitial region oscillates considerably around its mean value, the error made by replacing the real potential with a constant one could be enormous. The goal is therefore to have the interstitial region as small as possible9660 9680 9700 9720 9740 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 measured calculated ∆σ/σ 0 E[eV] general agreement of the two spectra is quite good but for the detailed quantitative analysis, the muffin-tin approximation has to be improved (or bypassed). A few successful solutions have been proposed, e. g., the use of the finite-difference method in the interstitial region

Conclusion:
We have seen that the information buried in the near-edge region of absorption spectra is understood quite well already: the XANES analysis can give details about the electronic structure and the local arrangement of atoms around the absorbing atom. XANES studies already seem to be a powerful and promising tool for the determination of the local structure of various chemical samples.A very important part of this seminar was certainly to illuminate the approach to the nearedge processes by the MS technique. Such "local" treatment of the scattering inside a small cluster of atoms can be used to explain the local chemical environment and local density of states and is thus suitable for studying amorphous materials, such as glasses or gels, as well as for crystalline matter, where other techniques have also been developed.Further attempts are being made to bring XANES analysis to a more quantitative level. The first steps in this direction are relaxing the muffin-tin shackles and the next ones may be even more sophisticated (e. g., taking care of correlation effects between electrons to go beyond one-electron approximation).
